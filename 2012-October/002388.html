<PRE>I've run into issues where with FLDIGI copying MixW stations the text is
garbled with Olivia. I would switch to MultiPSK and it was clear. In several
cases I found folks running 11125 sample rate on MixW and other programs
with native 44100 sound cards. Once they switched to the correct sample rate
for their sound card, the text was clear.

 

I'm not sure why MultiPSK manages to pull clean copy in these instances
where FLDIGI does not. BTW, I have never seen the garbled text issue when
all stations are running FLDIGI.

I switched PCs and thought the trouble I was having with people not decoding
me was my audio settings.  Today, after doing some work, it my be Olivia in
Fldigi.  I have tried 3 or 4 or the latest versiosn but when sending Olivia
peole receive mostly jibberish and it apepars similar to how I deocde them
In PSK31 there is no real issue.  Today I switched to Multipsk and people
could copy me where previosly with Fldigi, they could not.

Here is an example of the deode at my end.
