<PRE>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> On Sat, 29 Jan 2011 15:18:18 +0100, Pierfrancesco Caci &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/fldigi-alpha">pf at tippete.net</A>&gt; said:

&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i> after working on the it.po file for fldigi for a few days, I noticed
</I>&gt;<i> that some strings were not translated at all. Thinking that maybe some
</I>&gt;<i> calls to gettext were missing I went to look at the sources, and all
</I>&gt;<i> calls are indeed there. 
</I>&gt;<i> What happens is that the fldigi.pot (the master index of translatable
</I>&gt;<i> strings) is (purposedly) not rebuilt on each autoreconf;configure;make 
</I>&gt;<i> cycle. There is a special target that needs to be called manually. This
</I>&gt;<i> is:  
</I>
&gt;<i> make fldigi.pot-update
</I>
&gt;<i> from within the po directory. I have not been able to figure out if the
</I>&gt;<i> master Makefile has a call for it.
</I>&gt;<i> This target should be called when there are significant additions or
</I>&gt;<i> modifications to the source code.
</I>
Just to explain why the fldigi.pot file is out of date in GIT.

The target you mention above gets called by toplevel ``make dist'',
which is a bit of a nuisance because the &lt;lang&gt;.po and fldigi.pot files
are tracked by version control and become marked as modified every time
an (alpha) release tarball is built.

This is undesirable because it clutters the commits (alpha releases are
frequent).  The usual ways around it: undo the changes in po/ or
configure with --disable-nls.  Normally we only need to commit NLS
changes for public releases or when the translation files are updated.

But yes, as a translator you want to make sure this file is up to date.
