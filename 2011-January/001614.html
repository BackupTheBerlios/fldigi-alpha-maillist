<PRE>RTTY RU contest observations for the fldigi alpha list:

As noted in the appended posting to the fldigi list and the CTDXCC
reflector fldigi-3.21.0AB worked great in the 2011 ARRL RTTY Roundup
contest. For the fldigi alpha testers I did encounter two situations that
you may or may not have observed in testing. One could be operator error
and the other may be unique to my Mac setup.

Serial Generator Wake Up:

For reasons I can not explain the serial number generator would start
up and I would see SN's in the box that were not required for the ARRL
RTTY RU contest. I changed the Start to both zero and blank, did a
reset then quit fldigi. It is my understanding that quitting fldigi
should stop the serial number generator until a reset command is issued.
When I restarted fldigi the serial number generator would be off but
after some time and a number of QSO's it would start up again. I would
then have to restart to turn it off.

I wonder if there is some embedded macros or key combination that can
wake the sleeping serial number generator?  I am obviously doing
something wrong that launches the SN generator. During the contest I
wished there was an ON/OFF button in the Contest configuration pane
for the SN generator.

RX Panel Overload:

The other issue is something I have encountered in other contests that
neither Dave or Ed has been able to duplicate so may be unique to my Mac
setup. After copying and logging QSOs for some time, I would not be able
to select calls or reports from the main Rx pane until I used the
(right-click) button to Clear the screen. It acted like the Rx buffer
was overloaded. Happiness was the Clear button. It was really useful
and used in the contest!

In you testing let me know if you run into either situation or if you
feel there is something I may be doing wrong. So far I am the only
observer.  The waking serial number generator was annoying and time
consuming to edit out of the logbook one QSO at a time. The Rx overload
was easily corrected with a Clear command.

No need to comment unless you have a similar observation. As noted above
Dave has not been able to duplicate either.

My primary objective for the 2011 RU was to test fldigi-3.21.0AB and
worked great.

Never heard WY, saw DC (World Bank) and VT working S&amp;P but did not get
them.
