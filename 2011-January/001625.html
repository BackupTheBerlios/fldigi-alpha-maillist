<PRE>I pulled down the source code for flrig and fldigi last night
and compiled the applications, and did a little testing.

The two applications don't seem to like each other. When fldigi
is started, it causes my IC746Pro to &quot;bounce&quot; between VFO-A and
VFO-B continuously. It does not matter what I do within the
fldigi configuration, I can't get it to stop doing this with
this combination.

I do not have this issue with flrig 1.0.0-bP and fldigi 3.21.0BC.

I first noted this behavior with flrig 1.0.0-bR. The bR code is
when the program changed its &quot;look&quot; in the main window...and that
is when my 746Pro went &quot;bonkers&quot; with the quick-switch between
VFO-A and VFO-B. bX is a bit more well-behaved, although it seems
to take a while to settle down after startup - I note multiple
changes between VFO-A and VFO-B while the program is setting up
the radio for the last-used configuration on VFO-A. I also note
that on occasion the program fails to change the operating mode
(e.g., LSB to digital USB) correctly.

I experimented with the fldigi program and found that using
RIGCAT or Hamlib, things work just fine...as far as those programs
go. The whole reason I want to use flrig is that it is capable
of setting my rig to use the digital USB mode (D-USB), which is
not available with RIGCAT or Hamlib.
