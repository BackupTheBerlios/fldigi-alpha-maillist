<PRE>Skip,

Thanks for your comments.

I respectfully disagree with your analysis.  Often times (probably more 
than 50% of the time) I find that using my 500 Hz filter and defining 
the sweet spot as the center of that filter allows me much better 
decode, especially on a very weak station or when there is deep QSB.  If 
there is another strong station in the passband, it will push the radio 
AGC way down and I can lose a weak station, so when working weak 
stations or ragchewing (parked on a station for a while) I use the &quot;Dig&quot; 
mode and 500 Hz filter on my FT-100D.  Works VERY well with all modes 
with bandwidth less than or equal to 500 Hz.  Surely I'm not the first 
or only one to think of this or use it?!?  This is the same technique 
that has been used for generations on CW, and for similar reasons 
(improved S/N and AGC performance).

I know nothing about programming Fldigi, but it seems very possible that 
a macro could be built that would allow a text string that matches an 
entry in the pulldown list of rig modes to be set by a macro called 
RIGMODE, and similarly a text string match for the filter width in 
RIGFLTR, and I would think RIGFREQ would be easy to accomplish also.  It 
seems to me that this shold be possible in a way that is generally 
available to any defined rig in RigCat or Rig XML by simply using text 
string matching for the pulldown mode and bandwidth boxes.  If your 
particular rig does not allow filter or mode selection via CAT, then so 
be it, but I think most do.  I'm not thinking about interfacing macros 
with the external Flrig program directly, but with the RigCat or Rig XML 
built-in interfaces.

Of course, this all may be WAY too much trouble for Dave &amp; crew to code 
- I don't know...

-Joe-

&gt;<i> Joe,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That would require linking flrig controls with fldigi macros. Probably 
</I>&gt;<i> not feasible, and not all fuctions, perhaps like filter selection, are 
</I>&gt;<i> controllable through CAT commands anyway. Are you using any rig 
</I>&gt;<i> control program now? With PSK31, all the stations are found in the IF 
</I>&gt;<i> passband, so rig control is really not necessary. The DSP filters in 
</I>&gt;<i> fldigi are very sharp and steep-sided, so unless you have an AGC 
</I>&gt;<i> capture problem, a narrow filter is not needed, and besides, in order 
</I>&gt;<i> to use the PSK browser, you need a wide IF bandwidth anyway.
