<PRE>I'm seeing some Viewer oddities with the AFC on AW...

For some reason the AFC seems to hang on too long to signals or erroneous 
signals. I did spend a lot of time adjusting squelch to minimize this, but it 
still needs regular right-clicks to close out the erroneous detects and take a 
fresh look. 

The old browser was never this finicky.

I'll see a strong trace and see several wrong off-frequency decodes, clear them 
and the correct is found and decoding starts in the viewer. For some reason 
the new code is lots more finicky about getting &quot;lost in space&quot; on the center 
frequency of signals on the waterfall than the old decoder was.

The hang time is set to the 15 seconds default, but you do want time to see 
what was typed. Somehow the AFC is not working the way that it did before. I 
don't remember hardly ever having to clear the viewer to get reliable decodes 
working.

Maybe it's something on this end? If so, I can make adjustments and see what 
happens.

Maybe the AFC time needs to have it's range temporarily narrowed after a 
successful decode at least until the text-clear timeout is complete and the 
decoder line blanks again. That would cover QSO overs at least. If the other 
station wasn't copyable, the line would clear in whatever the time out was set 
to, 15 seconds here, and then start normal search again. 

Something is just different.
