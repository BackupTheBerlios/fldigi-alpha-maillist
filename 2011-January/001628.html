<PRE>The following is an after action report on fldigi-3.21.0BB and 0BC used in the 
24-hour UK-DX-RTTY contest. Both worked fine for me and I had no issues 
generating the Cabrillo and LoTW reports.

=======

I encountered some operator (cockpit) issues when I changed mid way from 
fldigi-3.21.0BB to fldigi-3.21.0BC. Yes, I know Dave has warned me about using 
a new alpha software release in contest.  I like to test new releases like I plan 
to use them and l do RTTY contesting.

The cockpit issue was with the serial number generator.  I had a hard time 
getting fldigi to accept the Configuration/Contest/Start to accept the new 
number entered in the Start box. After entering the new number (that was 
harder to type in than I expected), I clicked on Reset.  I went on with the 
contest and after one or two Q's it was obvious the Reset did not take. I 
had some really strange looking numbers being logged. I quit and restarted
a few times and finally got it working correct.  I have learned to look at the
#Out box after a Reset to be sure the correct SN is in the queue for the next
QSO. 

I ran into the same issue that showed up in the RTTY RU where after a number
of QSOs I could not select a call or report until I used the Clear button to clear 
out the Rx panel.  The Clear button worked most of the time but one time I had
to Quit and Restart fldigi and had to restart the SN generator.   I suspect this Rx 
constipation issue may be a port audio issue with Mac OS X as none of the Windows 
or Linux users have reported the problem. While trying to kick start the serial
number generator after some of the fldigi restarts, I lost three QSO's and could 
not find them in the captured log file.

One interesting good news item was I started the contest logging the received 
serial number in the #In box and then I screwed up and logged a number of 
reports in the Xchg box.  I realized I messed up and figured I would sort it out 
after the contest.  The good news is the fldigi prepared Cabrillo file sorted out 
the received reports and put them in the correct place. Fldigi is a pretty smart 
application.

I turned on the Signal Browser a few times to see who was calling CQ around 
me.  The RTTY Browser worked perfect but was more of a distraction than a help 
for this kind of contest.

The contest and logging macros all worked perfect and it was really nice to 
have the stacked macro sets. Thanks Dave they worked great and the flipping 
macro set issue of the past is history.

Fldigi-3.21.0BC seems ready for release.
