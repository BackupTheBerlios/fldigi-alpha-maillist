</I>Interesting.  I was curious, and looked in my server directory for the
cty.dat file and could not find it.  I looked in /.fllog, and in /fllog
and it is not there, yet on my remote fldigi, the country data still
appears, so I am going to assume it is finding the cty.dat file on the
local machine rather than getting it from the remote fllog server.   On
standard fldigi,  I put the cty.dat in the /.fldigi folder.  Is that
where it should be on the remote log server directory, in /.fllog?  If
not then where would be the best place for fllog to find it?  Note
fldigi is not running on the remote server.

While I was looking, I noticed that the log text .adif file had nothing
in it, although the gui panel had all the remotely enterd logs
appearing.  So I went to the fllog menu, File, and hit save.  Now my log
file has all the cached data in it.  So it seems a few things are not
really ready for remote operation.  The save function needs to be
automatic, or continuous, or something other than requiring a manual
save.  If the server loses power or something fails, I would really hate
to loose everything in cache that had not been saved.  Also I was unable
to edit the fllog with the normal update and delete buttons like I do
with fldigi, because they were all greyed out.  I have found mistakes I
make, or double log entries, that I would like to remove to make a
cleaner log, but was unable to.  I wondered  if it was a permissions
thing, and looked back in /usr/local/bin, and found write was limited to
root only.  Protection I guess.  I use Ubuntu where root is harder to
get to, so I changed the permissions to include me and now it works fine.
