<PRE> 

I want FLDIGI to detect incoming sideband conversations, extract the call
sign determine the distance and family history of the ham I am talking to
and automatically create and send QSL cards.

 

It should also auto detect my rig and auto install so I do not have to read
any manuals.

 

A nice to have feature for future consideration, as I do not want to over
burden the programmers. is to detect the amount of coffee in my cup and
interfacing with my cell phone, again all auto detect, and have it text the
XYL for a refill.

 

You might also consider a dog walking option that will know when I am in a
contest and again auto detect the contest, place calls and score the contest
logs as I am out with the dog.

 

I am sure that these minor changes to the program should not take any time
as it only took me a minute or so to think them up. If you want me to remain
a satisfied user of your free software you will get on these changes at
once. I would hate to have to dump your obsolete efforts and bad mouth your
software all over the place.

.

I want them! That should be a good enough reason to put them in. Oh by the
way I am running Windows 3.1 with 128K of memory so take that into
consideration. So many programmers today are creating 'Bloat Ware&quot;, like I
can really afford to add memory!
