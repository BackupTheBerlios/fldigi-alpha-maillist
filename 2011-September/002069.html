<PRE>Sorry for the delay... I was offline for the entire friday-today...

This are the results for the WWV calibration using fldigi 3.22.0AS:

Hardware:
      Desktop: Via P4 2.4Ghz 1Gb RAM, with 2 Sound cards
          OS: Ubuntu 11.04 custom kernel for oss support ***
          Radio: FT-747GX for WWV via Hamlib and TK-760 for 2m link (the 
2 interfaces are home made)
      Laptop: Dell Inspiron 1200
          OS: Ubuntu 11.04 default kernel
          Radio: FT-23R handheld, home made interface

As the sound card MUST one time base for &quot;TX&quot; and &quot;RX&quot;, the correction 
of the sound card must be the same in RX/TX...

the procedure was this

1 - Adjust RX correction on desktop PC as mentioned in fldigi help topic 
against WWV (in my case 25.000 Mhz was the most strong/clean at that time)
      Result: Correction was +33 (Ensoniq ES1371 [AudioPCI-97], PCI 
CARD, the small slant in the image is +33, and +34 have have the same 
slant, just in the other way, so the real adjust may be +33.5 or so... 
hi hi hi...)
2 - Apply the same correction on TX
3 - Use the new WWV TX mode to calibrate the RX on the Laptop against 
the signal from the Desktop PC using low power FM 2m link (<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/fldigi-alpha">1W at 145.010Mhz</A>)
      Result: Correction was -8 (Intel Corporation 82801FB/FBM/FR/FW/FRW 
ICH6 AC'97, laptop mobo)
4 - Apply the correction found on laptop to TX
5 - Test the correction of laptop against WWV to see differences between 
WWV and fldigi TX...
      Result: Perfect sync; hence fldigi is doing a great job and RX/TX 
correction on Esoniq PCI on Desktop is the same.
6 - Check TX of laptop against calibrated RX on desktop
      Result: Perfect sync; hence RX/TX correction on Dell desktop 
builtin soundcard is the same.
7 - Calibrate my mobo built in soundcard: VIA Technologies, Inc. 
VT8233/A/8235/8237 AC97 Audio Controller
      Result RX: ~ +1345 (against WWV and fldigi on laptop)
      Result TX: ~ +1350 (RX on laptop, moving TX o the desktop...)
      The corrections is so big that the small changes is almost not 
noticed, may be that is the cause of the difference on RX/TX...

This confirm my idea of the poor quality of the via sound card on the 
desktop (or bad driver support on linux, as it has some minor problems 
on ubuntu.. but that's another story...)

Then, the fldigi WWV calibration mode on RX is working ok (as always 
was) and the new TX mode of WWV for calibrating machines via VHF/UHF 
without &quot;original WWV in HF&quot; is working fine, as usual.

Attached a screen shot of my desktop machine calibration against WWV...

73, I hope this test help the developers a little.

PS: My WEFAX reception now is much better, as I have't any problems of 
slant now !!! see attachments

*** I use a custom kernel for OSS support for Tvtime and gnomeradio 
hack, all fldigi audio work in the desktop is done via /dev/dsp, that's 
why two sliders in RX and TX panels...

El 22/09/11 12:51, Ing. Pavel Milanes Costa escribi&#243;:
  &gt; Build fine on Ubuntu 11.04
  &gt;
  &gt; This night I will try to calibrate my laptop soundcard with my dektop PC
  &gt; which is calibrated to WWV
  &gt;
