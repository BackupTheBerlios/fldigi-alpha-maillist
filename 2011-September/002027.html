</I>&gt;<i> Interesting.  I was curious, and looked in my server directory for the
</I>&gt;<i> cty.dat file and could not find it.  I looked in /.fllog, and in /fllog
</I>&gt;<i> and it is not there, yet on my remote fldigi, the country data still
</I>&gt;<i> appears, so I am going to assume it is finding the cty.dat file on the
</I>&gt;<i> local machine rather than getting it from the remote fllog server.   On
</I>&gt;<i> standard fldigi,  I put the cty.dat in the /.fldigi folder.  Is that
</I>&gt;<i> where it should be on the remote log server directory, in /.fllog?  If
</I>&gt;<i> not then where would be the best place for fllog to find it?  Note
</I>&gt;<i> fldigi is not running on the remote server.
</I>
I moved cty.dat to /.fllog and removed it from /.fldigi. all fields are 
populated as you would expect including the country.



&gt;<i> While I was looking, I noticed that the log text .adif file had nothing
</I>&gt;<i> in it, although the gui panel had all the remotely enterd logs
</I>&gt;<i> appearing.  So I went to the fllog menu, File, and hit save.  Now my log
</I>&gt;<i> file has all the cached data in it.  So it seems a few things are not
</I>&gt;<i> really ready for remote operation.  The save function needs to be
</I>&gt;<i> automatic, or continuous, or something other than requiring a manual
</I>&gt;<i> save.  If the server loses power or something fails, I would really hate
</I>&gt;<i> to loose everything in cache that had not been saved.  Also I was unable
</I>&gt;<i> to edit the fllog with the normal update and delete buttons like I do
</I>&gt;<i> with fldigi, because they were all greyed out.  I have found mistakes I
</I>&gt;<i> make, or double log entries, that I would like to remove to make a
</I>&gt;<i> cleaner log, but was unable to.  I wondered  if it was a permissions
</I>&gt;<i> thing, and looked back in /usr/local/bin, and found write was limited to
</I>&gt;<i> root only.  Protection I guess.  I use Ubuntu where root is harder to
</I>&gt;<i> get to, so I changed the permissions to include me and now it works fine.
</I>
I'm seeing fllog updated and saved after each entry. There is no cached 
data that I could find. I can also update and delete entries. Root owns 
the executable in /usr/local/bin.

Basicaly fllog is working as it should, at least here.
