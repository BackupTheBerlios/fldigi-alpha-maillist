<PRE>I just jumped into the middle of the V5/DJ2HD RTTY pileup on 20 meters
and he was working split.  I was receiving him on VFO-A and setup to
transmit  up about 3 on VFO-B.  

I had the new fldigi-3.21.0AT Signal Browser engaged and when I pushed 
the listen button on the TS-570S the Browser was copying all of the signals
on VFO-B being sent 3 to 5 up.  This was cool because when I saw the V5
give a report I could push the button and see the station sending him a 
report so I knew where he was listening.

I went to school on a few QSO's then worked him.  The new Signal Browser
is going to be a nice addition for working DX.
