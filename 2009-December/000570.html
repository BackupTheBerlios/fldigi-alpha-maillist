On our wpaNBEMS nets, we use the non-compressed version of wrap because 
we're transmitting to many stations at once.  Not all the stations 
always get or need perfect copy, but have the benefit of getting the 
gist of the message even if they loose a character here or there.

Here's a bulletin we sent this morning.  You can see it's not loaded 
with critical data but we like to know if everyone got 100%.  I hate the 
idea of someone missing a few characters and winding up with nothing 
readable, as would be the case with the compressed version.  On the 
other hand, with the standard wrap, if someone saw the subject matter 
but got failure, they could just ask for a resend.

2009 WPA SEC Message-

FIRST SECTION NET-
Saturdays' 10:00 AM EST.  A directed net. 3.983kHz, LSB  Role Call by
District and County.  Please check in.

WX-
The first winter storms are upon us.  Pittsburgh area was virtually
closed due to an ice storm last weekend.  Heavy snow in Southeastern PA
today with lake effect snow for the NW predicted tomorrow.  Keep the
batteries charged and an ear to the emcomm repeaters in your area.

ALERTING-
Any ARES response depends upon first getting the message.  The most 
common alert is &quot;Listen to the repeater&quot;  Well what if repeaters are not 
useable? If your area has developed a good methods, please share it with us.

SET Drill-
I am compiling our scores for the SET Drill - it looks impressive.  If 
you have not already, please send your reports asap. Section report will 
be sent to ARRL by year end.

SET Planning Team-
We need a team to begin planning for next years SET Drill.  Part of the
process will be review of these years' results.  This Team will also
consider developing a Webinar highlighting our experience and challenges.

LOCAL Activity-
Murrysville, PA is planning a propagation study for the spring.  The
procedures are being developed now that will lead to a better 
understanding of signals from 2 repeaters and simplex frequencies.  More 
as the plan develops.

HAVE A HAPPY AND SAFE HOLIDAY!!

BTW, our wpaNBEMS WPA SEC Bulletins are being propagated throughout our 
section with great success!


&gt;<i> The purpose of compressing all files was to reduce the transmission 
</I>&gt;<i> time.  Files transferred using /flwrap/ contain data which must be 
</I>&gt;<i> verified.  If you are simply eyeballing the internal contents of the 
</I>&gt;<i> wrapped file you are defeating its purpose.  Why waste time with the 
</I>&gt;<i> headers etc.  Just transmit the original file and accept propagation 
</I>&gt;<i> errors.  If the data must be intact and verifiable then it makes no 
</I>&gt;<i> difference whether you can read the data during transmission or not.  If 
</I>&gt;<i> it cannot be unwrapped correctly then the data is useless.  A good 
</I>&gt;<i> example might be a spreadsheet in comma separated value (.CSV) format 
</I>&gt;<i> that contains numeric data.  How would you verify this data without the 
</I>&gt;<i> wrap technology.  You would either have to repeat the file transmission 
</I>&gt;<i> several times and then do voting, or the operators would have to verify 
</I>&gt;<i> item-by-item.
