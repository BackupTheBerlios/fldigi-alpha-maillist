<PRE>Season's Greetings!

When I use FLRig as a stand-alone application, I find that when I open 
the program it sets the rig in a different mode than before it was 
running.  Apparently there is some kind of &quot;cleanup&quot; activity which is 
sending a control code to the radio.  A similar thing happens when I 
exit the program.  I would prefer that when FLRig opens and closes it 
leave the radio unchanged, but simply poll the radio.

Also, I have a wireless mouse and several times have changed my 
batteries because the mouse was acting strange (intermittent sluggish 
pointer and button response) - thinking I had several sets of &quot;dud&quot; 
batteries.  I just found this morning that this has happened every time 
I run FLRig.  Keep in mind that this is with FLRig running stand-alone, 
and I am NOT transmitting so there is no RF problem.  As soon as I exit 
FLRig the mouse works perfectly.

I'm running Windows XP Pro, SP3, all latest updates, with the PC 
connected to a Yaesu FT-100D, and FLRig 0.9.97, 2.7 GHz Celeron CPU, 1 
GB RAM.

REVISION:  Before I sent this message, I experimented again with the 
timing parameters in the config, and that made no difference, even 
setting the timing to very long times (e.g., 1000 ms polling rate).  
However, I noticed that the RTS and DTR pins on the CAT serial port were 
checked/enabled, which is not necessary with my interface.  I turned off 
those boxes for no pressing reason other than they are not needed, and 
guess what happened to my surprise?  The mouse jerkiness stopped!  The 
only thing connected to that serial port is the CAT cable, so I'm a bit 
mystified by that.  However, I would still like the open/close mode 
change &quot;problem&quot; fixed.

73,
-Joe-
