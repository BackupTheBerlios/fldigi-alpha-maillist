<PRE>Tested at W5YM

Ubuntu 9.10 compiles fine
Runs fine from precompiled binary.  However it occasionally logs
W:rigCAT_getfreq: Retries failed   but seems to be working OK anyhow.
The radio is a TS940S and I'm using the TS440 rigcat file.

On Windows XP there are problems.  3.12.5 seems to be working OK under
Windows.  3.13BH   with rigcat doesn't get frequency from radio, but
can control the radio frequency.  Doesn't get mode but can control it.
logs W: rigCAT_getfreq: Retries failed

Trying hamlib it does get the frequency from the radio but displays the
mode as LSB no matter what it really is.  I think this is a previously-
reported problem with hamlib.

BTW we are having a problem with this computer since upgrading to Ubuntu
9.10.  The machine slows way down because the rate of context switches
goes high, like 700/second.  This seems to be because the mountall
program is still running after bootup.  When I kill mountall the rate
of context switches becomes more normal.  On a second machine, same
hardware, we are not having this problem with high rate of context
switches, or at least not as often, or at least not from the same source
as mountall doesn't seem to be running after bootup.
