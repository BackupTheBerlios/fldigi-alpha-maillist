</I>First I am glad it is not just me.  Dave, this only seems to happen when 
I am in QSO, so I have filled in the log with callsign, and maybe name.  
The first qso exchange is done by macro, and then on the second 
transmission which is by keyboard is where I have consistantly 
encountered this.  I see it when I try to type from the very upper left 
hand spot, and I try to type the other stations call sign in caps.  I 
generally have found this when the other station is typing, and I am 
trying to type ahead at the same time (I am a slow typer, and need to 
buffer before transmitting).   The receive (yellow screen) buffer 
generally has a lot of past data in it.  So guessing, it could be 
something left over in the blue screen from the macro transmission, but 
I thought that was cleared on &lt;RX&gt;, it could have something to do with 
typing while in sync and receiving.  I know this has happened in PSK31, 
but I think other modes as well, just not sure.  I will keep better 
notes now that I know it is not just me.
