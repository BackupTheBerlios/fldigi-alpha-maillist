<PRE>* w1hkj &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/fldigi-alpha">w1hkj at bellsouth.net</A>&gt; [2009 Dec 20 07:45 -0600]:

&gt;<i> I have tried banging away at the keyboard for several minutes and
</I>&gt;<i> cannot cause the described behavior.  Was this mode specific?  Was
</I>&gt;<i> the transmit buffer very full?  Did this occur on Ubuntu 9.10 on
</I>&gt;<i> both Al's and Nate's experience?
</I>
As it happened I was busy trying to type ahead of the station I was
receiving and didn't think too much the conditions of the program to
report a bug.

As I recall, I had some amount of text in the receive screen, most
likely several screens full as the slider was fairly small.  

I was receiving text from the other station.  

Some of the log entries were filled in.

The TX buffer did not have much in it, just a few lines.

I am running 3.13BG on Debian Unstable locally compiled.

73, de Nate &gt;&gt;
