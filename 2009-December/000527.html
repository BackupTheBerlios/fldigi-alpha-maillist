<PRE>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> On Sat, 12 Dec 2009 08:39:51 -0500, &quot;P.J. Rovero&quot; &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/fldigi-alpha">provero at ct.metrocast.net</A>&gt; said:
</I>
&gt;<i> &quot;JM51MP&quot; was interpreted as a Japanese callsign instead of
</I>&gt;<i> a locator code and &quot;spotted&quot; to pskreporter....
</I>
Matching calling stations in the received text is somewhat non-trivial,
and the current code tries to do its best to find callsigns but avoid
false positives.

I would very much like to see the surrounding text if you still have it.
It should be somewhere in ~/.fldigi/status_log.txt if verbose logging
was enabled.

Some time ago I was working on some improvements to the psk-reporter
regex matching.  I will resume this soon.  It would really help to have
a lot of logging output to test against and ensure that whatever changes
I make will work at least as well as before with respect to false
negatives.  False positives are harder to test for.

PSK reporter users, please open &quot;Help-&gt;Event log&quot;, drag the slider to
Debug, let fldigi spot some (many) callsigns and send me your logs! :-)
You can use the Log sources menu to disable sources other than Spotter
if you are worried about file size or overhead.  The logging messages go
to ~/.fldigi/status_log.txt and that file is overwritten every time
fldigi is started.

&gt;<i> I also noticed that the SNR estimate for Olivia
</I>&gt;<i> signals is gone, frequency offset is still there....
</I>
Will take a look at this.
