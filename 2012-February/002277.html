<PRE>Rob,

 

It's funny that you bring up the subject of remote ops as you described. I
just had a conversation a few days ago with a fellow from the Pennsylvania
Emergency Management Agency who needs to be able to set up FLDIGI for remote
ops from one building to another that houses their HF gear. He was asking
for the same thing and apparently HRD has this capability.

 

I've been using LogMeIn to do my remote ops of my home station from work and
elsewhere, which is what I suggested to him but they want remote control
without the latency associated with the screen control/login programs like
LogMeIn.

Subject: Fldigi separating the DSP from the GUI?

 

Hi Dave. et. al.,

I haven't been following things here lately.  Instead I have been playing
with ghpsdr3-alex &lt;<A HREF="http://napan.ca/ghpsdr3/index.php/Main_Page">http://napan.ca/ghpsdr3/index.php/Main_Page</A>&gt; .  It is SDR
software using DttSP that works with a server in the shack and the GUI on a
laptop or android connected over the Internet.  It sure would be nice if the
DSP engine and the GUI of Fldigi were separate, so we could run the DSP at
the server and the GUI at the remote end, with gdpsdr3-alex.  I also use
Fldigi to spot for the Websdr server we use on the WWU campus.  It would be
nice to run Fldigi without the GUI there as well.  Would separating the two
be terribly difficult?  Any plans in that direction?

73,

Rob
