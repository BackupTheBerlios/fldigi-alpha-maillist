<PRE>To hear some people's political opinions about Packet, you would think that it would not work at all.

Only thing is... It does work, and has worked FB on HF for decades. Not only that, but AX25 Packet does things that most other digital modes simply cannot do.

If you leave off the politics and just stick with observed reality, the fact is that no other digital mode has been developed yet to do what Packet does - but better. 

Q15x25 was a nice try, but in on the air tests, regular old HF Packet was more robust, and provided better throughput despite the lower baud rate. We had great hopes for Q15x25, but it did not prove to be better than 300 baud Packet.

The old urban myth about Packet being technically unusable on HF was started in the late 80's by amateur TCPIP buffs who were frustrated because nobody liked amateur TCPIP.

The situation hasn't changed... HF Packet is still going strong, and the myth-makers are still frustrated because nobody likes amateur TCPIP.

          Just FYI....HF Packet is alive and well NETWORK 105 (Since1986) is strong and growing.
          40 plus stations on 24x7 Most are running personal mailbox and LOTS of kybrd&lt;&gt;kybrd.
          Also, SKIP Net is on several bands that are BBS .

  The problem is, &quot;packet&quot; desperately needs an overhaul. The use of an FSK modem operating at 300 baud is seriously counterproductive on a HF path. Packet needs a MUCH better modem with FEC. Likewise the use of fixed timing in the protocol makes for poor performance in the presence of multiple stations. Also packet could benefit through the adoption of selective reject instead of go-back-N in the ARQ portion of the protocol. 


  Other than that ...
