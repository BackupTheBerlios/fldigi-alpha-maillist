<PRE>
The SCS company has developed an alternative mode to 300 baud Packet 
called Robust Packet. I've been testing it in one of their Tracker 
modems ($350) for some time now and it is robust. If you like Packet and 
need a modem that works under adverse conditions, this is it.

Short demo here <A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOLk4n1ypJU">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOLk4n1ypJU</A>  The video 
was recorded during a test link between myself and N9LYA on the 20 meter 
band.

I'd love to see a similar mode in FLDIGI some day.

Robust Packet Specs:

Baud Rate: 200/600
Modulation: 8 tone PSK
Bandwidth: 500Hz

</I>&gt;<i>     If you leave off the politics and just stick with observed

</I>&gt;<i>     yet to do what Packet does - but better.
</I>&gt;<i>     Q15x25 was a nice try, but in on the air tests, regular old HF
</I>&gt;<i>     Packet was more robust, and provided better throughput despite the
</I>&gt;<i>     lower baud rate. We had great hopes for Q15x25, but it did not
</I>&gt;<i>     prove to be better than 300 baud Packet.
</I>&gt;<i>     The old urban myth about Packet being technically unusable on HF
</I>&gt;<i>     was started in the late 80's by amateur TCPIP buffs who were
</I>&gt;<i>     frustrated because nobody liked amateur TCPIP.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     The situation hasn't changed... HF Packet is still going strong,
</I>&gt;<i>     and the myth-makers are still frustrated because nobody
</I>&gt;<i>     likes amateur TCPIP.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And here I thought that the old AX.25 vs. TCP/IP wars were over. I 
</I>&gt;<i> know I moved on. I guess there are die-hards everywhere. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And for what it's worth, if we compare the success of TCP/IP with the 
</I>&gt;<i> success of any flavor of X.25, including the mis-named AX.25, well, 
</I>&gt;<i> the jury is definitely in on that topic. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But getting back to AMPR on HF, consider: that something works does 
</I>&gt;<i> not mean that it is optimal and cannot be made better. And my comments 
</I>&gt;<i> about both the FSK modem and the AX.25 protocol specifics are true no 
</I>&gt;<i> matter who speaks them. Phil Karn and I did an excellent analysis of 
</I>&gt;<i> the AX.25 shortcomings back in the 1987 or 1988 ARRL Computer 
</I>&gt;<i> Networking Conference. We ran computer simulations and then backed 
</I>&gt;<i> them up with real-world observations of live networks. And the 
</I>&gt;<i> observations and conclusions haven't changed, even after 25 years. 
</I>&gt;<i> (Wow, has it been that long?)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, just because it works doesn't mean it can't get better. And just 
</I>&gt;<i> because someone who likes TCP/IP says it, doesn't mean it isn't true. 
</I>&gt;<i> Frankly, I couldn't care less about running TCP/IP over an HF link but 
</I>&gt;<i> I do think that it is possible to craft a better protocol that will do 
</I>&gt;<i> what AX.25 is doing, but do it better and more reliably. It would be 
</I>&gt;<i> quite interesting to see progress in this area rather than arguments 
</I>&gt;<i> about how adequate it is.
