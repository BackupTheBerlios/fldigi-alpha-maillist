And here I thought that the old AX.25 vs. TCP/IP wars were over. I know I
moved on. I guess there are die-hards everywhere. :-)

And for what it's worth, if we compare the success of TCP/IP with the
success of any flavor of X.25, including the mis-named AX.25, well, the
jury is definitely in on that topic. :-)

But getting back to AMPR on HF, consider: that something works does not
mean that it is optimal and cannot be made better. And my comments about
both the FSK modem and the AX.25 protocol specifics are true no matter who
speaks them. Phil Karn and I did an excellent analysis of the AX.25
shortcomings back in the 1987 or 1988 ARRL Computer Networking Conference.
We ran computer simulations and then backed them up with real-world
observations of live networks. And the observations and conclusions haven't
changed, even after 25 years. (Wow, has it been that long?)

So, just because it works doesn't mean it can't get better. And just
because someone who likes TCP/IP says it, doesn't mean it isn't true.
Frankly, I couldn't care less about running TCP/IP over an HF link but I do
think that it is possible to craft a better protocol that will do what
AX.25 is doing, but do it better and more reliably. It would be quite
interesting to see progress in this area rather than arguments about how
adequate it is.
