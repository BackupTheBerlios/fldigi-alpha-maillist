<PRE>This was reported to Dave W1HKJ the same day as his big WX event by
email. I have no idea if he received the report but would like to archive 
it for when his life returns to something more normal.

I recently updated my setup to a direct USB interface and ran into an 
issue getting the Hamlib option to key the Kenwood TS-590S.  The 
workaround has been to use the RigCAT option. The issue is the same in 
fldigi-3.21.9 and 3.22.0AA.

The issue or problem is the &quot;PTT via Hamlib command&quot; option in the 
Hamlib configuration pane is now dimmed and fldigi does not key the
rig when the Hamlib option is selected for rig control.

     &lt;<A HREF="http://www.qsl.net/aa5vu/temp_hamlib.png">http://www.qsl.net/aa5vu/temp_hamlib.png</A>&gt;

When I first discovered the issue, I changed over to the fldigi RigCAT option
and it allows me to transmit. Since then I have been running tests to 
understand what caused PTT option in Hamlib to not function and to be
dimmed.

First, the issue may not be new because I in the past I let the SignaLink
USB Auto-PTT circuit take care of the PTT and I never needed to check the 
box or even tired to use the Hamlib software PTT option. I am now using 
the direct USB (TS-590S to iMac) interface and the software PTT option is 
necessary.

To hep figure out what happen I started over by trashing my fldigi_def.xml 
and fldigi.prefs files. I then downloaded and installed a fresh copy of
fldigi-3.21.9.dmg.  I do not think this issue is unique to the OS X version
of fldigi because another TS-590S  Windows user has confirmed the same 
observation.

I used the fldigi setup wizard to enter data. When it came time to enter the 
rig control options, I selected the Hamlib option and it worked! The PTT option 
was checked, it was NOT dimmed and rig control was seemed to be working. 
That was the good news. The bad news was I could not get fldigi to key the 
rig.  The Hamlib PTT option was not working. I then changed over to RigCAT 
and could key the rig; however, going to RigCAT caused the PTT option in 
Hamlib to dim and no longer be active as shown in the screenshot listed above. 
I do not understand how selecting the RigCAT option caused the Hamlib
PTT option to dim. I have not been able to make it active.

I suspect there is something wrong with the PTT option in the Hamlib used
in the current fldigi. The reason I prefer Hamlib over RigCAT is Hamlib
displays the frequency of VFO-B when operating split for working DX.

FYI, another big advantage of using the direct interface is it allowed me to 
get rid of the old Keyspan Serial-to-USB adapter that was preventing me from 
being able to use RigCAT at anything over 9600 baud. The direct USB is working 
FB at 115200 baud.

I am open to suggestions on how to get the Hamlib software PTT option to
key the rig.

Ps: I do not need comments that your Hamlib works with other interface devices. 
I never had this issue with the SignaLink.  It seems to be unique to direct USB interface.
