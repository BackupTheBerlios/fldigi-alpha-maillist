Ideally, if a rig backend in question did not support PTT (or any other
operation) the application can query the rig capabilities and determine
that.  In this case, both the ts570 and ts590 backends have support for
the PTT function.  The code is shared by most all Kenwood backends so if
it works with the '570 it will work with the '590 as the same function
is used for each.

&gt;<i> The SLAB_USBtoUART used in the Device selector is the USB to UART Bridge

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In addition to working with the Kenwood TS-590S, I understand the Silicon

</I>
I had tested it with the K3 (uses the exact same code as the 570/590
would) some months back.  I have not done anything with Fldigi for some
time (probably since late last year).  In fact, I used Hamlib command
keying with the FT-920 and now the K3 to free up a serial port.
