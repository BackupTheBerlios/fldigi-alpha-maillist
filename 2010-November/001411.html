<PRE>This is an interesting debate that I have been involved with in some 
other forums on LinkedIn and elsewhere.

There seems to be two schools of thought from emergency managers, 
hospital system admins and communications volunteers.

One is that agencies should have the flexibility of modifying the ICS 
forms to better suite their needs. The other is that ICS falls under the 
National Incident Management System (NIMS) and all forms should be in 
the standard FEMA format 
(<A HREF="http://training.fema.gov/EMIWeb/IS/ICSResource/ICSResCntr_Forms.htm">http://training.fema.gov/EMIWeb/IS/ICSResource/ICSResCntr_Forms.htm</A>).

I side with the latter and take the position that there should be no 
such thing as a modified standardized form... kinda a contradiction in 
terms and theory. And, BTW, much to my dismay... my opinion is in the 
minority.

However, as an amateur radio emcomm volunteer, my job is to send and 
receive data and traffic EXACTLY as the served agency presents it to me 
and my team members and without error.

Here is one of the comments from another forum member with whom I agree, 
wholeheartedly:

                      #############################################

Somehow I think the concept of standardization has been lost in this 
discussion. An ICS 213 Form is an ICS 213 Form. I don't think it is 
perfect for every application, but if you decide that it needs to be 
changed to work in your environment then you have created a new form. 
Your modified form is not an ICS 213 Form, and you should not call it one.

I recommend that if additional information is required to process the 
message, then an additional routing form or disposition form be attached 
as required. I suggest that failure to maintain the expected format 
might delay the transmission of the message and &quot;might actually hinder 
an effective response to an incident&quot;. Simple items like Incident Name 
and Message Number can be incorporated into the existing fields by 
procedure.

The suggestions in this thread that communications will never go outside 
of your local agency imply to me that you have never been involved in a 
real emergency. If that is really the case, you don't need the ICS 213.

In my opinion, failure to use an ICS 213 Form when it is required should 
result in a negative assessment.
