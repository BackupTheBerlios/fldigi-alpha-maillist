I agree that needed to be fixed. But a cabrillo wants date and time off, 
not on. But the ARRL has always been the odd man out.

The saving grace is Dave allows the user to select what he wants or needs.

Plus we have the option to edit the log.

</I>

In any contest you want date off and time off.

You are correct, but any contester worth his salt, has the macros set 
exactly as needed. But in the heat of battle it may come in handy.



&gt;<i> There is another bug that exec macros are inserting spaces even if there
