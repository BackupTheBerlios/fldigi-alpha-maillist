<PRE>Well, as I stated in my previous message, our job is to send and receive 
the data from served agencies, with 100% accuracy, as presented to us, 
to the best of our ability. NBEMS/FLDIGI/FLWRAP/FLMSG has already proven 
to be the most impressive toolkit in the bag with this regard.

But if we're going in with a blank slate, I think the FLMSG toolkit 
should emulate the national FEMA standard forms. Any qualified/properly 
trained NBEMS emcomm volunteer should be able to easily make changes 
from the FEMA/NIMS standards on the fly.
