So far so good.

Are you certain that this was what he was trying to do?

Fldigi should be able to put the rig into FSK mode, and then if the user 
has selected the pseudo-FSK on right audio channel, a proper FSK audio 
waveform is available for rectification and driving an opto-coupler to 
generate the FSK contact closure the rig needs. He should be able to set 
the sweet spot for RTTY to the center of the rig's filters, and a click 
on QSY would then move the QSO to that place in the rig's passband. Of 
course you could always use the VFO to tune around as we used to in days 
past. But the crossed ellipse scope in Fldigi uses the same filters that 
the RTTY modem does, and these are far too narrow to get the expected 
rotation of the crossed ellipse display that we are used to for quick 
VFO centering. And the waterfall seems too slow also. The pulse display 
is better. But for VFO dialing, I'd prefer a separate set of wider 
filters driving just the crossed ellipse display (with a reverse 
rotation option, to get the rotation to match the VFO dial direction) so 
that it rotates as scope displays used to do on the old analog TUs. Then 
searching and pouncing using VFO rotation would be fast and intuitive.

&gt;<i> As a test I used the fldigi radio mode selector to change my TS-570S
</I>&gt;<i> to RTTY-FSK and logged a dummy QSO.  When exported, it showed up as a
</I>&gt;<i> CW mode in the ADIF file as CW was the last Operating Modem I had
</I>&gt;<i> used.
</I>
I would think that the contact should have been logged as RTTY.

&gt;<i> Has anyone tested the logging effects caused by changing the fldigi
</I>&gt;<i> popup radio mode selector?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyone been successful in doing FSK/AFSK setup for Rx and Tx?
</I>
Interesting idea, but does that really allow the use of the rig's tight 
twin-peak filters? Wouldn't pure FSK be better? With tight filtering you 
aren't going to see anything outside the rig's passband on the 
waterfall. And with the rig's filters set to wide, why not just use AFSK.

I still am not sure what the idea was that was trying to be 
accomplished. Was the user trying to have a sort of dual setup? Wide rig 
filters for waterfall clicking and searching and then a click to narrow 
filters for digging out a weak one, except that then he needed the rig 
to be in FSK mode using a contact closure to generate the FSK and not 
AFSK to the mic?
