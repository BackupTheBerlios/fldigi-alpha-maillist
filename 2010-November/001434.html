<PRE>I think where NTS should shine is with health and welfare traffic. Most 
of the NTS folks I know don't know or care what ICS is. And, conversely, 
emergency management doesn't know what NTS/Radiogram is. NTS, from my 
experience and in my region, really isn't about working with emergency 
management agencies.

One of the things I'd like to see is to have at least a few NTS folks in 
our area utilize NBEMS/FLDIGI/FLMSG during a mass casualty test to see 
if they could handle something like 50 health and welfare messages from 
a single location. Digital would be the only practical means of doing so 
from a shelter, for instance. I would envision a single basic message 
saying we're at the ??? shelter and we're ok. And then a CSV data sheet 
of the destination addresses and phone numbers sent separately. Once the 
book traffic hits the various nets, who cares what mode it goes by... as 
long as the NTS folks can deliver the message.

Katrina proved that the current system of health and welfare message 
handling was then (and is probably still today) unable to cope with a 
major disaster. The Salvation Army (SATERN) website just basically shut 
down after they got tens of thousands of health and welfare requests.

My hope is to try to spark some interest in trying to solve the high 
volume traffic handling problems with health and welfare messaging in a 
disaster with the use of NBEMS. You'd think it would be a fun and 
interesting challenge for the NTS system that they would embrace... 
we'll see.  As was mentioned earlier, most of what NTS is passing in the 
way of traffic now are unsolicited messages. I would have some interest 
in participating in NTS if I didn't run the risk of picking up a spam 
message I'd have to pass. Unfortunately, there's no way to know what 
kind of traffic you're going to have to handle until you accept it.
