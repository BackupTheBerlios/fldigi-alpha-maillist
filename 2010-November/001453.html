Leigh WA5ZNU,

With regard to sorting time for contests, export using the Logs/Export
Cabrillo 
and you will only see TIME_OFF displayed and sorted. All contests logs are
time off.

Dave's recent addition of the Date and Time for both ON and OFF is a good
thing and would have paid off for me when I was trying to work the new
PJ2MI 
entity on RTTY. Only a hand full of people managed to get a PJ2 on RTTY on
the opening few days. The big gun PJ2T station only did CW and Phone. A
few 
days later PM2MI came up on 40 meters and created one of the largest RTTY
pileups I have seen for some time.

Like everyone else I needed PJ2MI so I selected his call and fldigi placed
it in the time on box in the main QSO pane. My station and skills were not
that good to work him right away. Some time passed and I made a number of
calls before he heard me and sent a report. I just happened to look at UTC
Clock in the corner of the Mac desktop and it showed at 0000z. I
acknowledged 
the QSO and clicked the LOG macro.

My log at that time showed I started the QSO many hours after I ended the
QSO 
because only one date was shown. Using the dumb LoTW TIME_ON this would
have 
been a busted or orphaned QSO. I recognized the issue and manually
corrected 
the fldigi logbook file to show both Time ON and Time off to the same date
and 
time at 0000Z.

With Dave's new implementation of the ADIF specification, this kind of
problem
will take care of itself in that the log will show the correct date and
times for both ON and OFF. Like I said this addition is a good thing.

With regard to PJ2MI he later confirmed by email that he uploaded our QSO
to LoTW as 28-Oct-2010 at 0000z. The ARRL has blocked all PJ QSO's until
after the first of the year; however, I know my PJ2MIl will be a good
QSO.

I don't know if my other posting was distributed to the alpha list but I
log 
all of my QSO's as TIME_OFF and have requested a new macro from Dave that
will 
let me sync TIME-OFF to TIME_ON. Just like the current hover-push thing
over 
the time On box. This macro will not be for everyone. Many still like to
log 
both time on time off.
