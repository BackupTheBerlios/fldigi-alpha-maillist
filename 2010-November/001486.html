<PRE>Fldigi's failure to log modes may be unique to fldigi-3.20.30 and
does not apply to fldigi-3.21.0AO.  If you have used version 3.20.30, 
I suggest you check your Logbook to verify logged modes on recent 
QSOs. This has been reported to Dave

Disregard my other comments about FSK and AFSK.

&gt;<i> I have been working with another user that provided me a copy of his fldigi-3.20.30 export.adif file that he could not sign using the LoTW's tqsl app.  Yes, his fldigi exported ADIF file was missing all modes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When he sent me a screen shot, it was obvious he was using
</I>&gt;<i> the fldigi radio mode popup selector (under the Frequency Display) to put his Icom 756 Pro III into FSK-RTTY and the fldigi operating modem box in he lower left corner said RTTY. He included a print of his Logbook the mode was
</I>&gt;<i> blank.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think he trying to receive RTTY on one VFO in radio FSK mode to take advantage of the Pro III's RTTY fiters that do not work in AFSK this may have caused the problem. I have no idea how he can transmit in AFSK on the other VFO and be on the same frequency that he is receiving on in FSK.  Sounds too hard to me or the Pro III is really smart rig.  It may not be big deal for split operation but it would be a pain for simplex. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As a test I used the fldigi radio mode selector to change my TS-570S to RTTY-FSK and logged a dummy QSO.  When exported, it showed up as a CW mode in the ADIF file as CW was the last Operating Modem I had used.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Has anyone tested the logging effects caused by changing the fldigi popup radio mode selector?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Anyone been successful in doing FSK/AFSK setup for Rx and Tx?
