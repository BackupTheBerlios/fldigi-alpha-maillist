<PRE>I understand what you are saying. But we also have to realize that everything is not perfect. The original ICS forms were designed to be delivered in person. Once you add amateur radio to it, it adds more layers of complexity.

You have to be able to track where the message came from. Where it was passed to. And if and to whom it was delivered. None of this information is was designed be be put on the form itself.

Maybe what we should be looking for is a &quot;framework&quot; to wrap the actual messages in. A envelope of tracking and routing information contained in flmsg and passed with the messages. This information would be kept in a database with the message itself. The message could be printed separately without the envelope information and given to the recipient. Or we could hand them the envelope information also if they need it. This would allow us to give them exactly what they want and have our info too. 

This would probably take a bit of work since it would need to be able to be customisable as there are many different versions of even an ICS-213 form out there.
