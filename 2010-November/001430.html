I don't really think it is a holdover of the ARRL system, but let's
remember that the message format we're discussing the the ARRL format,
not NTS format as it's commonly known.  I also don't think emergency
agencies require it.  I comment was directed to routine traffic handled
by the NTS (no, it's not dead), daily, on a regular basis. 
Unfortunately, most of the traffic that moves is what would be called
SPAM if sent via email; a message going from someone to someone who
he does not know.  But I guess it keeps us in practice.

Be that as it may, I haven't seen any urgent traffic moving that is
formatted in the ARRL format in a long, long while.  As a matter of
fact, in the true emergencies that I've helped with you sent,
or requested, information in the manner that the stations in the
affected area wanted it, or not at all.  And it was NOT in any
kind of format.  This was before all of the ICS stuff.  Whether
this would change or not now I have no idea.

Given a choice in handling messages I'd pick a digital mode over
any other mode available to Amateur Radio.  And I'm very good at
CW and I work with a lot of others around the U.S. that are also
very good.  I'd still pick digital.  And I've been known to say
that my hope would be someone on the other end that is receiving
my messages would also have Pactor 3.  But I'm prepared to use
whatever mode is available IF I have to do so.
