<PRE>This is the reason we have decided to use one standard form.
We maintain a message log for accountability.

Flwrap fulfills most of what we need as it unwraps the information correctly
on the receiving end when used as part of the communication process.

Any Radio service not just the Amateur service has the same challenges.
That requires trained and qualified operators to put the information in a
meaningful format for the agency/unit they are assigned too.

Often we may actually transcribe the information into a specific form/format
as requested by those we serve and attach the original message as received.
This provides full accountability and tracking.  This function of a Radio
Operator really hasn't changed that much since the spark gap days.

This is an area where ARES and others in the Amateur Community can really
excel and provide meaningful services to their communities.  Some even cross
train to augment agencies primary services in times of need.

Now, once we get a high dollar mobile Satellite system brought to the area
from some distant unit, then we can provide all types of complete services
including attaching a document and using the Internet with direct
connectivity and solve all the problems including high bandwidth proprietary
formats like X-rays.  All with complete accountability and traceability.
(until it goes down of course).

It all boils down to using a standard approach including forms that
accomplish most of what everyone needs.

No system will ever be perfect not matter what we attempt to do.

We can, however, do a really fine job with the Fl Suite of tools that rank
right up there with some of the best radio techniques and capabilities of
Federal Agencies and the Military.

We can always tweak and improve our processes as time goes on and certainly
the points you bring up should be kept in the basket of concepts to push the
development.

Keeping this type of cordial dialogue, is the source of the best innovation
one can ever have.

I thank all of you for what you do and the ideas you put forth.  Personally
I take them back to our unit and share them.  It helps us improve our
services.

Again Thanks,

Mike
