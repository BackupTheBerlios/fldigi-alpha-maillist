And it all else fails you re-introduce the user service to the universal
form mark 1.
Take one sheet of blank paper.
Start writing.
Repeat as needed.
Actually if receiving a form that a printed black it not available for
the above results in a cleaner copy than trying to fit to a different
form.
The dis-advantage being you have to ask for the printed parts of the
original to be sent as well as the written.
Granted the above is more relevant to Voice or CW but since a message
may well change modes en-route 
We have come along way since the telegraph by with his bicycle but that
is still the fall back when all else fails.

I must get round to trying the latest version to see if the UK preferred
forms match any of the included ones.
