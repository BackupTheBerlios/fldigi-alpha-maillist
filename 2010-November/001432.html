<PRE>I quit fldigi-3.21.0AN for a few hours. When I came back, the waterfall
display
was dark blue. I could hear signals on the rig; however, nothing was being
decoded or showing on the waterfall display. I quit 3.21.0AN and installed a
fresh version of 3.20.29 and it was also deaf. I then replaced my
fldigi_def.xml 
with a known good backup and that did not help at all.

I know the problem is within fldigi and not in my Mac or SignaLink USB
because 
I started cocoaModem and it decodes and was showing all kinds of signals on
its 
waterfall display.

As a last resort I replaced my fldigi.prefs file with a fldigi_def.xml.zip
backup I 
keep in the .fldigi folder and after a restart the waterfall came alive.

I have no idea what caused the problem (deaf waterfall) but it seems to have
something to do with how fldigi saves or updates the fldigi.prefs file when
it quits.

My advice to all alpha testers is to keep a backup zipped copy of you
fldigi.prefs
file handy just in case your waterfall goes deaf.

Seems to be working FB now with both 3.21.0AN and 3.20.29.
