<PRE>I've been checking out flrig for about 4 weeks now, and it's
about time to provide a list of results and comments.

First things first: the configuration!
Radio: Icom IC-746Pro
Computer: AMD K8, 2.4 GHz, 2GB RAM
OS: Ubuntu 10.04 x86_64
Software: fldigi 3.20.28 (stable) and 3.21.0AM (alpha)
Interface: SignaLink USB sound card
CI-V Interface: Home-brew RS232-to-TTL with USB-to-RS232 converter

I started using flrig because neither hamlib nor RigCAT appear to be
capable of activating the 746Pro's digital SSB mode. The digital mode,
among other things, cancels the speech compressor. I could not always
remember to activate this mode when using fldigi.

Overall, I'm very pleased with the enhanced control that flrig provides.
Not only can I control the digital mode, I can also control other
settings such as my power output, attenuator, and noise reduction
from my computer. The GUI interface is easy to work with. I wish it
were a little bit larger, however, that's minor.

I have noticed, on occasion, a lag between when I set something on the
computer screen and when the radio responds. To use the &quot;human factors&quot;
description, the amount of time is longer than the 0.1 second that
an average person would consider reasonable for a reaction to an input.
I am pretty certain that this lag time is due to my computer hardware,
and not an issue with the software.

I have noticed that the software will &quot;hang&quot; if I turn my 746Pro off
before I shut down the software. Is there a graceful way to handle
this situation?

I have not noted any significant issues if flrig is running and if I
inadvertently start xlog, which uses hamlib for rig control.

My wish list is very short. Since I use flrig for control of my radio
for both voice and digital modes, I would really like to have control
of the speech compressor...and preferably on the main panel. (I tried
to implement this by adding functions to the source code, without
success, and I bet it's because my C skills are rusty.) I'd also
like control of the auto notch filter mode from the front panel...I
have found the auto notch to be more effective than the manual notch.

I'm a tough grader, so when I say this software gets a 9.5 out of 10,
it's definitely a well-written and robust application. Kudos to Dave
and the development team!

73,

Eric
