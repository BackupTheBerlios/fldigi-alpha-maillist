<PRE>I used fldigi 3.21.72BW.dmg in the 20/21-July-2013 North American QSO Party (NAQP) RTTY contest and it worked great. My setup was fldigi on a 27-inch iMac using OS X 10.8.5 with a USB interface to a Kenwood TS-590S.  Fldigi was easy to use and I had no after action issues with either the NAQP or LoTW robots. Both robots accepted the fldigi generated Cabrillo Report on the first pass.

----------

Using alpha, beta and a developer preview OS software in a contest does have risk; however, fldigi-3.21.72BW performed nice. No crashes or other nasty stuff.

For the fldigi alpha team the following are some performance and user interface observations for future thought:

- The new RTTY decoder worked very good.  I did some runs in CQ mode and when they stopped calling I changed over to S&amp;P mode. Decoding worked great in either mode. The only issue was some newbie RTTY operators would only send their call one time and sometime had to use the AGN macro a few times. Most RTTY operators send their call 2 or 3 times. Fldigi got most on the fist call!

- The only issue that I have seen before with previous versions of fldigi was sometimes mouse-selection of calls in the Rx panel gets hard. By hard I mean I would mouse on a call and had to do it several times and sometimes nothing happened.  When I noticed this happening, I used the Clear button and most of the time that solves the problem; however, a few times when I could hear and see a signal on he waterfall but fldigi was not decoding and I had to quit and restart fldigi. It was like an Rx buffer was full and needed to be reset.  I am not sure if this a fldigi or Mac USB Audio CODEC issue but restarting fldigi clears the problem.  A fast restart in a contest like the NAQP is no big deal since you do not have to reset the serial number generator. SN's are not part of the NAQP exchange. The NAQP exchange was Name and State/Provinces only.

- I am not lobbying for contest scoring engine in fldigi but it would be helpful if there was column in the Logbook display for the &quot;Exchange In&quot; data logged. Users could eyeball the data to see if a State or Prov had been logged. It could also an easy way to see that QSO's have been logged correct. My personal workaround for WAS contests like the NAQP or the  RTTY Roundup is to keep a WAS Cheat Sheet on the Mac desktop and mark off the States when worked, like a Bingo card.  I leached this template from W7AY's cocoaModem that has a real time WAS tracker. In Chen's program the state turns Green when logged.



The bottom line is fldigi-3.21.72BW worked great under the stress of contest use.

Thanks guys!
