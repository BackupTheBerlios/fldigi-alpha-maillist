<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>I have been working on a new Bayesian Morse decoder for FLDIGI for a while.
The goal was to have a CW decoder that adapts better to different operators
rhytms, sudden speed changes, signal fluctuations and noise and still is able to
decode Morse code fairly accurately.

While this software is not perfect and has some bugs I am happy to release this
brand new version for alpha testing.  I finished the software integration to
FLDIGI v3.21.75 and spent few hours today listening bands.  Below is a small
example of W1AW code bulletin at 3.58105 MHz  received with KX3 and a side by
side comparison of legacy CW decoder  vs  Bayesian decoder:

The full source code is available in here: &lt;<A HREF="http://www.w1hkj.com/ag1le">http://www.w1hkj.com/ag1le</A>&gt;

I would like to get some alpha testers who are not afraid of compiling this code
from sources,  playing with it, breaking it and hopefully also helping me to
find the bugs.
For example  - the noise level estimator (noise.c) needs some serious work.  If
you have a algorithm that does the job better this would be one place to start
improving.  Also, if you know Viterbi or Kalman filter algorithms like your
pockets I would like to get help fixing a bug that appears in posterior
probability calculations in probp.c occasionally.

Anyways,  happy holidays for all FLDIGI users and hope to work you over the
radio.
