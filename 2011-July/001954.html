<PRE>I wonder if there is any ability for Fldigi to incorporate the CALLID
feature that Multipsk has?  I think that this feature would be very
useful for NBEMS nets  and even help automatically  maintain a list of
check-ins.  Most of the  NBEMS have a check-in procedure that is VERY
long.  Use of CALLID would dramatically reduce the net check-in time.
I usually use Multipsk when I check in to digital nets but since most
other stations use Fdigi, the addition of this feature for Fldigi
would be quite useful.  I think, not sure, that it would even detect
several callsigns  at  almost the same time,  if they were spaced out
a little.

Andy K3UK



Use of the &quot;Call ID&quot;
identifier of call sign and  Locator and use as &quot;Prop ID&quot; or &quot;Message ID&quot;

Main use
This &quot;Call ID&quot; (&quot;Call&quot; for &quot;Call sign&quot;) identifier can be,
automatically, detected and located. It can be any Call sign or Call
sign 6 characters + Locator, Prop ID or Message ID (see further). The
Call ID is always detected at -13 dB (first decodings at -18 dB), so
with a sensitivity better than the PSK31 one. The central frequency of
the identifier (which is also the central frequency of the
transmission), is determined with a precision of +/- 2.7 Hz. As soon
as this identifier (without any error) is received, Multipsk:

display, on the waterfall,  the call sign, possibly preceded by &quot;CQ &quot;
and possibly followed by &quot;Emergency!&quot; (and a short ring), the Locator
and station data (Prop ID),
display the time of reception, the call sign, the Locator and the
Signal to Noise ratio in the Call ID reception window,
switch on the received frequency (optional),
display the position the Locator on a map (optional).
This identifier is transmitted in 3.3 sec and has a bandwidth of 172
Hz.  It is composed of a RS ID (code 153) followed by a sequence of 56
bits of data and 24 bits of CRC. For the RS ID information, click on
Use of the Reed-Solomon identifier (&quot;RS ID&quot;) of mode and frequency

This identifier can be transmitted by clicking on the &quot;Call ID&quot; button.

As a RS ID, it can be decoded either in the detection mode &quot;On demand&quot;
or in the detection mode &quot;Continuous&quot;.

The &quot;Management of the mode identifiers (ID): RS ID, Call ID and Video
ID&quot; option of the &quot;Configuration&quot; menu or the button &quot;ID&quot; permit to
open a window where are located different options relative to
transmission and reception of RS, Call and video identifiers.

Note: for the programmers of coding/decoding softwares, I propose, on
demand, the source in Pascal (Delphi) for the creation and management
of the sequence of 56 bits of data and the 24 bits of CRC.

Most simple use

The default options being a search in 200-2500 Hz on the mode
&quot;Detection on demand&quot;, the user will have only to click on the &quot;RX
Call ID&quot; button. The Call ID identifier received in the 200-2500 Hz
bandwidth will switch Multipsk on the central frequency given by this
identifier.
It will be displayed the call sign on the waterfall and various pieces
of information (time and Signal-to-Noise ratio). If a Locator is sent,
the call sign will be positioned on a map.

Principle
It can be transmitted:

either a formatted call sign (14 characters max),
or a free call sign (10 characters max),
or a 6 characters call sign followed by the Locator,
or a &quot;Prop ID&quot; (&quot;Propagation ID&quot;) composed of a 6 characters call
sign, a Locator on 4 characters &quot;+&quot;, the power level, the antenna type
or gain and the directivity of the antenna.  The &quot;Prop ID&quot;  could be
processed to determine the real propagation conditions, but the main
use is to define the station,
or a message (Message ID of 9 characters max) to use during a QSO. It
is an auxiliary function.
This ID sequence is composed of 80 bits, i.e 20 symbols of 4 bits
transmitted as in RS ID transmissions shared into:
  * 56 bits of data
  * 24 bits of CRC (in fact 2 CRC: one of 16 bits and the other of 8
bits, of the same type of the Packet one)
This sequence must be preceded by a specific RS ID (Code 153).
The CALL ID is immediatly transmitted after the RS ID.
The transmission of the CALL ID symbols is done exactly as for the RS
ID symbols: same MFSK modulation (4 bits) and same AF frequency
bandwidth.

There are 16 possibilities of frequencies separated by
11025/1024=10.766 Hz, each symbol transmission being done on only one
frequency for a duration equal to 1024/11025*1000=92.88 ms. So the 35
(15+20) symbols are transmitted in 35*1024/11025=3,3 s.

It is a free error transmission, i.e in presence of an Call ID, there
are two solutions:

either the Call ID is not received because the signal is too weak,
or it is received and it is correct, the probability of detection of a
wrong identifier due to radio noise being almost nil.
Transmission

In all modes (included MT63, SSTV, Fax, FELD HELL...), an identifier
can be transmitted. It will be sent on the average transmission
frequency, except in SSTV where it will be sent on the synchronization
peak on the waterfall display (between 1150 and 1400 Hz).

Reception

In all the modes, included Fax, SSTV and MT63, the Call ID can be detected.

It could possible to choose the bandwidth (between 500 Hz and all the
spectrum). In this space, any identifier will be detected (in time and
in frequency).

Important: all the digital modes are supposed to be transmit in USB
with their standard shift (for example, 170 Hz for the RTTY 45 bauds).

Relatively to the average transmitted power:

The ratio between the average power and the maximal power is equal to
1 because it is a sequence transmitted in MFSK. This ratio equal to 1
is an advantage because it is transmitted the maximum energy during
the 3.3 sec of the sequence.

Options and commands on the identifiers management window for the RS
ID and the Call ID (common to both identifiers)

Click on Use of the Reed-Solomon identifier (&quot;RS ID&quot;) of mode and frequency

Options and commands specific to Call ID

Options (for reception)
As soon as the Call ID is received, Multipsk:

display the call sign (possibly preceded by &quot;CQ &quot;) and the Locator on
the waterfall,

display the time of reception (UTC), the call sign, the Locator and
the Signal to Noise ratio in the Call ID reception window. This window
can be cleared (&quot;Clear the Call ID window&quot; button).
If a client application is connected to Multipsk through TCP/IP link,
the same information (as a &quot;comment&quot;) is also sent to this client
(see Multipsk control through a TCP/IP link).

switch on the received frequency, if the option &quot;Switch of the
frequency on Call ID&quot; is on duty,

display the position the Locator on a map, if the option &quot;Automatic
positioning of the call on the map if Locator received&quot; is on duty.
On clicking on the &quot;See the hidden map&quot; button, if the map on which
appear positions, is hidden behind the RX/TX screen, it is set on top,
so as to see it.

If &quot;Call ID ---&gt; CALL_ID.TXT&quot; is checked, it is automatically added
the Call ID pieces of information in the &quot;CALL_ID.TXT&quot; file
(sub-directory &quot;WORLD&quot;). The addition is done at the end of the file.
This file can be periodically examined by the user (programmer) for
any use. The user must empty this file from time to time.

If &quot;QSO fields&quot; is checked, it is automatically filled the QSO fields
(RX/TX screen) using the Call ID information: &quot;Call&quot;, and possibly
&quot;Locator&quot; and &quot;Notes&quot; (for &quot;CQ&quot; and &quot;Emergency!&quot;).

If &quot;---&gt;Spot&quot; is checked, it is automatically transmitted  an outgoing
spot to a cluster through SpotCollector, using the Call ID information
(RX/TX screen) which fills the QSO fields: &quot;Call&quot;, and possibly
&quot;Locator&quot; and &quot;Notes&quot; (for &quot;CQ&quot; and &quot;Emergency!&quot;). If the &quot;Freq MHz&quot;
QSO field is empty, nothing is exported.

To start the Call ID, the user must click on the &quot;RX Call ID&quot; button
on the RX/TX main screen.

Call ID and RS ID monitoring without actions

With the button &quot;RS ID and Call ID monitoring on standard waterfall&quot;,
RS ID and Call ID are monitored on the standard waterfall and are
displayed on the blue line (finished by an &quot;OK&quot; button), without any
mode and frequency forcing. However, it is proposed to switch on the
Call ID frequency or the RS ID mode and frequency.

The &quot;Beep&quot; button permits to generate a beep on reception of a RS ID
or a Call ID.

Commandes (in transmission)
It can be transmitted:

either a formatted call sign (14 characters max). For this, check on
&quot;Transmission of your call sign, in a formatted way&quot;.
With this option, in case of justified emergency, it can be checked
&quot;Emergency&quot;. It makes know that the transmission of the call sign is
designed for emergency needs (high priority). In this case, it is
added &quot;Emergency!&quot; to the call sign and a very short sound is emitted.

or a free call sign (10 characters max). For this, check on
&quot;Transmission of your call sign, in a free way:&quot; and fill the
corresponding field (10 characters max). The accepted characters are
A..Z, 0..9, space and /


or a 6 characters call sign followed by the Locator. For this, check
on &quot;Transmission of your call sign (6 characters max) + Locator&quot;,

or a &quot;Prop ID&quot; (&quot;Propagation ID&quot;) composed of a 6 characters call
sign, a Locator on 4 characters &quot;+&quot; (precision: +/-0.5 &#176; in longitude
and in latitude), the power level (0.5 to 500 Watts), the type of the
antenna or its gain (4 to 19 dB) and the directivity of the antenna
(&quot;NW&quot; for &quot;North West&quot; for example). For this,  check on &quot;Prop ID:
callsign+Locator(4+)&quot;.

Select the Power level (effectively radiated power transmitted by the
antenna taking into account any losses), among the proposed powers
(0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 or 500 Watts).

Select the type of the antenna or the gain of the antenna (if
monodirectional) among the following options:
* &quot;Vertical&quot;: vertical antenna (omni directional)
* &quot;Dipole&quot;: dipole antenna (gain around 2 dBi with a foreward and
backward radiation),
* &quot;Bidirec.&quot;: Bidirectional antennas as colinear or group of parallel
antennas (with a foreward and backward radiation), the gain being
close to 5 or 6 dBi
* &quot;4 dBi&quot; (for example Quad loop)
* &quot;7 dBi&quot; (for example 2 elements Yagi)
* &quot;10 dBi&quot; (for example 2 elements Quad or 3 elements Yagi)
* &quot;13 dBi&quot; (for example 4 to 7 elements Yagi or 3 elements Quad)
* &quot;16 dBi&quot; (for example 5 elements Quad)
* &quot;19 dBi&quot; (for example multi elements Yagi or Quad)

Notes:
The gain in dBi is relative to the isotropic antenna (same power in
all directions).
If the gain is expressed (4 to 19 dBi), it is supposed that the
directional antenna is a Yagi or a Quad antenna, the backward radiated
power being reduced.
In the case of a vertical antenna, the directivity will not be taken
into account.

Select the the antenna directivity (taken into account if the antenna
is not vertical is superior to 0) among the proposed directions: &quot;NE
(North East), &quot;E&quot; (East), &quot;SE&quot; (South East), &quot;S&quot; (South), &quot;SW&quot; (South
West), &quot;W&quot; (West), &quot;NW&quot; (North West), &quot;N&quot; (North).

It can be transmitted a 'CQ ' previously to the call sign (except for
the free call sign) by checking &quot;CQ&quot;. This CQ makes know that the
transmission of the call sign is done to initiate a QSO or to answer
to a QSO. Without CQ bit, it means that it is a one way beacon (for
propagation etc).

In case of justified emergency, it can be checked &quot;Emergency&quot;. It
makes know that the transmission of the call sign is designed for
emergency needs (high priority). In this case, it is added
&quot;Emergency!&quot; to the call sign and a very short sound is emitted.

The macro &lt;CALL ID&gt; (see Personal data and macros) permits to transmit
the Call ID in a sequence. For example, it would be possible, inside a
sequence, to send the Call ID to introduce yourself, then send the RS
ID to make switch the other Ham to the desired mode:
&lt;TX&gt;&lt;CALL ID&gt;&lt;RS ID&gt;
CQ CQ CQ CQ CQ CQ DE F6CTE F6CTE
CQ CQ CQ CQ CQ CQ DE F6CTE F6CTE
CQ CQ CQ CQ CQ CQ DE F6CTE F6CTE +K
&lt;RX&gt;
The program switches to TX, sends the Call ID then the RS ID and a CQ
call. Afterwards, the program switches to RX.

Important: to send a Call ID in reception (only one transmission or as
a beacon), use the button &quot;Call ID&quot;. In transmission, use the macro
&lt;CALL ID&gt;.

If  &quot;Beacon&quot; is checked, it is transmits a Call ID at each interval of
time defined by the user, as soon as the button &quot;Call ID&quot; (RX/TX
screen) is pushed.
The interval of time is adjusted with the arrows between 10 seconds to
20 minutes.
If the user wants a fixed AF frequency on the waterfall, without AFC
effect, it will be necessary to select the CW mode and extract the
&quot;QRP decoding&quot; button if pushed.

The Call ID is transmitted at each interval of time defined by the
user, once the &quot;Call ID&quot; button on the RX/TX main screen is pushed.

The pieces of information &quot;Call sign&quot; and &quot;Locator&quot; are available by
clicking on the &quot;Personal&quot; button. These pieces of data are used for
all the formats except the free call sign.

The button &quot;Check&quot; permits to check that the call sign and, possibly,
the Locator are correct.


Initial Message ID (9 char. max): it is possible to send a message of
9 characters maximum (with the following set of characters (56) A..Z
0..9 space . ? = / + ! - , ; : % &lt; &gt; $ &quot; ( ) * ), in background. As it
is not related to any specific mode, it can be useful, for example, in
case of difficulty of doing a QSO (thanks to the editor over the &quot;Call
ID&quot; button on the RX/TX screen). Message ID are not considered as true
Call ID and are not stored.

The main use is simply to send a short message in case in difficulty
during a QSO (&quot;PSE PSK10&quot;, for example, to ask &quot;To switch to PSK10&quot; or
&quot;QRM +1K&quot; for &quot;There is QRM, I increase the dial frequency by 1 KHz&quot;
or &quot;STIL HERE&quot; to say that &quot;I'm still here, even if communication
seems impossible&quot;.


It could be also possible to exchange information between Hams doing
other QSO, or between a Ham not in QSO and Hams in QSO, for two
reasons:
- the Call ID is received and transmitted in background so it can be
used at any time and in any mode,
- the Call ID appears to everybody in the bandwidth.
For example &quot;Hi mode?&quot; to say &quot;Hello, what is the mode that you use&quot;
and it can be answered &quot;OL 32 1K&quot; for &quot;Olivia 32 carriers 1000 Hz&quot;.


It will be efficient to use Q code and Ham abbreviations and to use
punctuations to limit the number of characters:
- &quot;?&quot; question (a confirmation is required),
- &quot;!&quot; a strong demand is done by the Ham with who you are in QSO (an
action is required),
- &quot;&gt;&quot; or &quot;-&quot; for &quot;to increase the frequency&quot;,
- &quot;&lt;&quot; or &quot;-&quot; for &quot;to increase the frequency&quot;,
- &quot;=&quot; at the beginning without following space for &quot;PSE &quot; or &quot;Please &quot;
- &quot;+&quot; at the end of the message for &quot;I wait for an answer&quot;
and why not net general smileys as &quot;:-)&quot; for &quot;Smile&quot;


The &quot;Standard parameters&quot; button selects the default paramaters.The
Call ID is transmitted by clicking on the &quot;Call ID&quot; button on the
RX/TX main screen
