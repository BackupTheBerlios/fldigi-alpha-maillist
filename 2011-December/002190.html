<PRE>I understand much of the motivation lies behind APRS operation, as opposed 
to unadulterated Packet. APRS is normal Packet with its most advanced 
features deliberately disabled, joined at the waist with the internet for 
the bulk of its functionality.

For HF APRS, the digital mode utilized for the RSID feature for example 
would be far superior to AX25 Packet that has discarded the primary features 
of AX25.

Why they would use Packet for HF APRS is beyond me, they could have tossed 
blindfolded at a digital-mode dartboard and had a better than even chance of 
coming up with a better choice.

Be that as it may, I would certainly not recommend Packet Radio, either the 
full-boat or the cripple-ware version for EMCOM.

Signal-flag wavers may go on about using what you have and I agree - but if 
all I had was a signal-flag, you can be sure that my eye would be open for 
something significantly better!

FLDIGI offers a number of modes that are not specific to NBEMS. Other than 
the ever present danger of creeping featurism nixing the FL part of FLDIGI, 
I don't see why anybody should object to another mode being offered. The 
folks doing the coding would know more about that than anyone here on the 
list, I figure.

&gt;<i>I don't understand the recent interest in packet. It was a big deal in the 
</I>&gt;<i>late 80's and I even hold HF Packet WAS Certificate #5. We all had TNC's 
</I>&gt;<i>but the technology was just too slow because FCC would only let us use 300 
</I>&gt;<i>baud on HF.  The advent of the internet and reliable email killed jnos and 
</I>&gt;<i>other BBS system and Packet. I gave away my PK-232's.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What's with all of the renewed interest?  I have no plan to ever use ax.25 
</I>&gt;<i> again and do not appreciate the need for adding it into fldigi.
