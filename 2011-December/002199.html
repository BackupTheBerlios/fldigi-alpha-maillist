That is all well and good. If you are going to do that then make your
remote device be the router/gateway, not the host computer. In that case
encapsulating in IP makes sense.

Usually when you are going to the trouble of encapsulating a network or
link layer protocol in IP it is to band-aid another problem, usually where
someone wasn't thinking and something has been fielded which would be
difficult to change. We aren't doing that here. Here we are trying to get
an AX.25 network/link layer to talk to a modem. This is pretty much a
physical-layer translation function with in-band signaling. If that modem
exists inside the same machine with the AX.25 engine, then it makes the
most sense to use the most suitable form of internal interprocess
communications available. If you are talking about an external device like
a real KISS TNC then the right answer is RS-232. If all you have to
communicate with your gateway device is IP, then you have no choice. But
the selection of proper transport depends on what your topology is and what
is available in the hardware.

So, even though I am a very strong proponent of IP/TCP/UDP for doing
things, I am not in favor of treating them as my favorite hammer and then
treating everything else as if it were a nail.
