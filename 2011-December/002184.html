<PRE>My feeling is if you are relying on the Internet for Emcom you are in for a surprise one day. 

Fldigi and NBEMS provides excellent radio to radio and even automatic print to screen of messages. I'm not sure I see the need for adding packet to Fldigi   

Seems to me there are plenty of programs and hardware for that purpose and they work very well. I use my KPC3 still today for specific purposes but not for my Emcom requirements in general.  I find it much easier for messages to open in the web browser using NBEMS works very well and doesn't need constant attendance either. We have had good success over great distances and even on HF with some modes using that utility. 

It is an idea with some merit but I wonder what return is to be legitimately realized to the amateur radio community and those we hope to serve given the coding effort that may be required to accomplish the task and equal the performance of dedicated TNC's. 

I'm not sold on the need. But then again that is just my opinion and that is of one person. 

All have a great day.
