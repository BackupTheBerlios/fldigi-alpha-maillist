<PRE>I'd like to see something as simple as an FLMSG form to spot your
coordinates by sending an APRS beacon from FLDIGI. Shooting out a short text
message to APRS from FLMSG/FLDIGI would be pretty cool, too.

It is still in use and has viable purpose in the emcom realm.

Locally we use FBB for store and retrieve of informational bulletins over
simplex range networks for inter township and county level relays during
RACES events.

We also have line driven database apps on packet where check ins to storm
shelters and hospitals are entered. Giving us regional ability to locate
persons on request.

Message traffic can be run via NBEMS but that relies on receiving stations
being up when sent. FBB of course saves the message for later retrieval and
an archive.

Packet still has use in the toolkit.

I also simply play with it because it is fun...though I'm one of very few
locally who do

 

 

Chris,

 

Thanks for the update. I was not aware it was being used. If something is
useful and being used it is good and fun to play with too. 

 

Maybe it will be good addition to fldigi.
