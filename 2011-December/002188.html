<PRE>List:

Just because some don't use packet on HF, doesn't mean we won't encounter
it on HF. For that matter, that doesn't mean fldigi will only be used on HF
- or only by hams. SWL's use it too (I'm more of an SWL these days than a
ham, I think.)

Packet TNCs are still being sold by multiple parties. That alone indicates
enough interest for support, I would think. Locally, there are still at
least two VHF packet BBS's, one of which has an Internet gateway on it.

What I don't understand is an exclusive focus on &quot;moving forward.&quot; While I
appreciate new modes (and in fact am listed in the ARRL handbook as the
inventor of some of them), that doesn't mean it's time to throw out old
ones.

Isn't a reasonable goal for fldigi to (eventually) be able to demodulate
anything we hear? Perhaps respond in kind, if possible? As opposed to just
the most recent or modern modes? We have CW... doesn't that seem to
indicate that if a mode is in use... no matter how antiquated or slow it
is... that it can have a place in the software?

I'm all for prioritizing too - maybe packet should be somewhere down the
list - but to just give up on it... I don't think so.
