<PRE>Packet in the sense of BBS in our area here in Pittsburgh is dead. We have a
lack of infrastructure (digi's). But there are two other amateur radio
infrastructure items that are going strong... one is VHF/UHF FM repeaters
and the other is ARPS digi's. MT63 2k long with NBEMS/FLDIGI/FLMSG is our
bread and butter for FM ops on simplex or repeaters. But APRS is another
very valuable tool. 

I think it would be a fantast value add to NBEMS if we had the ability to
have our NBEMS deployed operators send an APRS beacon from an FLMSG form
that would state their position, tac call and a short message. If that
beacon eventually hits a IGate, then the info is available to anyone on the
internet. If not, it can still be viewed by any station running APRS in the
local area such as a home APRS digi or a club station or EOC.

If there were a major emergency/disaster, the main action is at the local
level. It would be a great advantage for an EOC, for instance, to be able to
look at an APRS map and see where their key digi ops are located and also
get some additional basic information on their station ops without having to
break into a busy net to get the info.

I absolutely agree.  With the advent of WINMOR/RMS, that more than meets the
needs.  It would be a significant step backwards and one that I certainly
don't support.

I don't understand the recent interest in packet. It was a big deal in the
late 80's and I even hold HF Packet WAS Certificate #5. We all had TNC's but
the technology was just too slow because FCC would only let us use 300 baud
on HF.  The advent of the internet and reliable email killed jnos and other
BBS system and Packet. I gave away my PK-232's. 

What's with all of the renewed interest?  I have no plan to ever use ax.25
again and do not appreciate the need for adding it into fldigi.
