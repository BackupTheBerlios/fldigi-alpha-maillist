Well, FEC is the right idea but building it into the network protocol as
opposed to making it part of the modem, doesn't make a lot of sense. (AX.25
is actually an adaptation of a link-layer protocol to be a network protocol
for a datagram-based network, something that annoyed the heck out of people
when Phil Karn pointed this out in the late '80s.) If we were dealing with
a pure AWGN-dominated channel, e.g. space communications, you can get away
with putting it there. It is less so if you are using it on NLOS
terrestrial VHF/UHF/SHF links and even less so on HF links.

So, no, I don't think that is the proper approach. The FEC should be
matched to the characteristics of the MODEM in the medium where the MODEM
is being used. Olivia, MFSK16, and Thor have the right idea. Now we need to
layer a proper ARQ on top of that. And please don't assume it should
necessarily be an antiquated stop-and-wait ARQ with fixed timing like we
have used in AMPR, PACTOR, and AMTOR. Adaptive ARQ is now common AND we
have the option of changing what we think the unit of data transfer should
be.

AX.25, even when used as a point-to-point reliable link, fails badly for
all the reasons that Phil and I outlined in our paper for the ARRL 7th
Annual Computer Networking Conference in 1988. We applied our findings to
running TCP/IP over packet radio (this is where the KISS TNC came from) and
proved just how much more robust packet radio could be.

It was kind of funny. For that effort I was accuse of trying to ruin packet
radio for everyone else. :-) From that I went on to develop PPP.
