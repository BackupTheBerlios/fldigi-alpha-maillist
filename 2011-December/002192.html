Well, it was always supposed to be a serial port. Phil Karn, Bdale Garbee,
Mike Chepponis, and I defined KISS as a quick and dirty way to get raw
AX.25 frames into a PC via an async port. I came up with the idea but my
bisync-like protocol was rejected in favor of Mike Chepponis' proposal to
just extend SLIP by adding command and protocol ID fields. I have to admit,
it was a much better approach.

In the case of running where both the TNC and the KISS client are inside
the same machine, I would expect to find a virtual serial port program
connecting the two. OTOH, in unix I would probably use a named pipe. I
would NOT use a socket in the networking stack. It makes no sense to me.

Isn't there an AX.25 stack already inside linux? If so, it probably expects
to connect to a TTY port for connection to a TNC. You need to use a pseudo
TTY to get that bytestream over to your sound-card modem.

And the Bell 103 modem is a really, really, really, really, really,
STUIPID, STUPID choice for HF. This is where it would make a huge amount of
sense to use a different modem with IP, TCP, and UDP layered atop. Just
look at all the much-better modems exist in fldigi. Why keep using crap
like the bell 103? If we had a way of running IP over HF, with or without
link-layer ARQ, using decent modems with FEC, it would be SOOO much better
and also quite interesting!
