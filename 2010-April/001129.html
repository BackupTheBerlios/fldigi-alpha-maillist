The problem with comparing these things is knowing wheter you are comparing
apples to apples. What is the block size? What is the interleave factor?
What is the amount of redundancy (FEC rate)? Is the base modulation MFSK or
IFK? This is not magic. One is not better than the other; each is just
different. (Well, there are exceptions to that statement -- RTTY just sucks
and should be outlawed. :-)

I would be willing to bet that, with a few minor changes, THOR or
DominoEX/FEC would perform as well or better under most conditions. But what
are those conditions? By your implication, the characteristics of the path
you use on UHF favor MFSK over IFK but since we are dealing with different
levels of FEC we just don't know. It may be that, properly tweaked, modes
using IFK (DominoEX/Thor) will outperform MFSK. Remember, we can apply the
same FEC to both. But then, they will likely have different bit error
patterns which means optimization will require different parameters.
