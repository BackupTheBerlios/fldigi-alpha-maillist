<PRE>Brian,

 &gt; I often hear people talking about preserving bandwidth and I wonder 
why that is such a goal? Sometimes increasing bandwidth can improve 
performance to the point where you get all the bits through in a shorter 
period of time, making the channel available to others. Think about 
spread-spectrum or packet radio vs. RTTY for example.

This the argument that Winlink tried to foist upon everyone over five 
years ago when asking for unlimited space. The fallacy of that argument 
is that the frequency (or channel)  is dominated by one station that 
keeps the channel occupied until &quot;its&quot; traffic is passed, whereas, if 
more stations, say five, can fit in one of our limited frequency ranges 
and pass traffic simultaneously at only 1/5 the rate, the chances of 
more than one station successfully passing traffic, even at a slower 
rate, is greater than the chances of a single wide station passing its 
traffic. In the limit case, the wide station keeps trying to pass 
traffic without any success at all, but prevents other stations from 
using the frequency when one or more of them could have been successful 
in passing traffic.

The same it true for spread spectrum, or even HSMM. The idea is that a 
station is on for only a short time, so it creates QRM on that frequency 
for only a short time, and that is supposed to be acceptable for the 
harmed station, as they can just repeat their transmission, or perhaps 
the signal is so weak it is not noticed. The problem occurs when many 
spread spectrum stations try to use a band of frequencies at one time. 
In the aggregate, they will QRM the majority of stations over the band 
in question, since there are few places where others can operate without 
any QRM at all.

In layman's terms, a single wide signal can blanket the entire passband 
of a receiver (let's say MT63-2000), and it is not possible to filter 
out that signal. You have to wait until it is finished passing traffic, 
no matter how fast it transmits. In the extreme, if you use a 50 Hz wide 
IF filter for PSK31, 40 stations can occupy the IF bandwidth at one time 
without any of them capturing the AGC or interfering with each other. 
Again, signaling theory can probably make a scientific argument for 
conserving bandwidth so a band of frequencies is available to more than 
one station at any given time.

All the &quot;get on and get off fast&quot; arguments may be valid on wired 
circuits, where access is controlled, but they tend to fall apart in 
practice on the HF bands where space is so limited and access is random. 
As a recent example, ROS uses spread spectrum, occupies 2200 Hz of 
spectrum, but currently is only able to handle two stations on the 
frequency at one time without interference between stations, and the 
weak signal performance is no better than MFSK16, for example, in 1/6 
the bandwidth.

The simple reason that narrow bandwidth is such a goal is that it gives 
more stations the &quot;opportunity&quot; to use a limited number of frequencies 
at the same time, and speed of traffic passing is not so important for a 
50 wpm QSO, which is the speed that G3PLX chose as a reasonable speed to 
accommodate a most typists. PSK63 is twice as wide, so only half as many 
stations can use the same frequency range, but the speed (100 wpm) is 
greater than needed for ragchews. It was only intended to be a RTTY 
replacement for contests, in less bandwidth, but just as fast as RTTY 
overall. However, there is a penalty of 3 dB in minimum S/N for the 
extra speed, so for ragchews, PSK31 is sufficient and twice as many 
stations can use the same range of frequencies simultaneously.

That is how I see it from a layman's viewpoint...
