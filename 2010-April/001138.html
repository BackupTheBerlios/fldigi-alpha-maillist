<PRE>Our group has settled on the specific modes we use through trial and 
error under the exact conditions and bands we would find ourselves using 
in an emergency. By running 3 nets a week for well over a year now, 
we've found that on 80m and 10m, Olivia 8/500 is the best compromise for 
speed, accuracy, tuning forgiveness and bandwidth for shorter messages 
and keyboard chat. On occasion we have to switch to the much slower 
16/500 olivia, but that's rare.

For larger messages and spreadsheets on 80m and 10m we use MT63 1k long. 
We do a broadcast transmission with a WRAP file and then go around the 
table with amazingly good results with all but the stations reporting 
the weakest rx signals.

On FM we use MT63 2k long.  Again, it seems to be the best compromise 
for speed, accuracy and tuning forgiveness.

Interestingly enough, there are a ton of new digital sound card emcomm 
and traffic nets popping up on 80m, many of which tried MFSK16, Domino 
and others, but they all seem to land on 8/500 olivia just like we did. 
And I've heard nothing but good things from those using MT63 2k long on 
FM.  We have tried the PSK modes (including R) as well as the very 
wide/fast MFSK and Olivia modes on FM, but nothing seems to out perform 
MT63 2k long.

Anyway, my point is that on paper and s/n ratio tests, many modes come 
out as looking better than Olivia and MT63, but there's no substitute 
for running MANY nets with more than one other station under varying 
conditions.

We're always willing to try new modes, but we always wind up with Olivia 
and MT63 being the best overall fit for our needs here in WPA.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is somewhat more complex than it sounds...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Oh, I figured that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what would work right
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> now would be to generate two audio files (with signals at suitable
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> frequencies of course) and mix them using another program.  I'm sure sox
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can do that in one short command line.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;dope slap to the forehead&gt; Duh! Of course! And that would be very simple.
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, that is what Chen did for his testing too.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In fact if fldigi had xmlrpc methods to start/stop audio file

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> needed for your tests.  I guess I'll need to write those xmlrpc methods
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> first :-)

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Time to take the next step and build on Chen's work by getting real,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> controlled data from live propagation.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Some comparisons have been posted to the digitalradio yahoo group.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There is one by K2MO, and another by WZ7I.  URL for the latter:

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The tests done by K2MO are in the files area of digitalradio, and he has
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> posted them to the group a few times too.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I can't say how scientific those experiments were, but I know that the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> path simulator used (pathsim) is GPL'ed so at least that aspect of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tests can be verified by anyone so inclined.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The problem as I see it is that we have these similar-but-different fixed
</I>&gt;<i> modes; e.g. olivia, contestia, MFSKx, DominoEX, and then the various flavors
</I>&gt;<i> of PSK; that make multiple changes but don't allow us to evaluate the
</I>&gt;<i> protocols while only changing one parameter at a time. That is certainly
</I>&gt;<i> useful for hams wondering which mode to try now but isn't helpful in
</I>&gt;<i> selecting which mode is likely to perform best. Where *is* the crossover
</I>&gt;<i> between IFK, MFSK, and PSK?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hmm, wouldn't it be nice if the transmission header contained a descriptor
</I>&gt;<i> of the MODEM/CODEC so that the receiver could put together the correct
</I>&gt;<i> pieces.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ES1HJ also has published some test results but I don't recall if they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> were on-air or simulation tests.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> OK, there is a lot more research than I was aware of. I am trying to soak
</I>&gt;<i> all this up (and feeling like I am drinking from a fire hose) with the idea
</I>&gt;<i> of eventually building something to automate the process, i.e. evaluate the
</I>&gt;<i> channel and then configure the best operating mode. Thank you for all the
</I>&gt;<i> pointers Stelios.
