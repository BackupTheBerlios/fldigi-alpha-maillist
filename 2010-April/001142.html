<PRE>Brian,

 &gt; But when the path provides less loss, you can take advantage of that 
extra S:N to do one of two things: increase speed (less energy needed 
per bit) or decrease power. And who cares how fast someone types. Why 
should the transmitter be on for the entire time the person is typing? 
Why not transmit when some or all of the message is ready?

This is the principle of the &quot;typeahead&quot; buffer, which almost all PSK31, 
and other digital programs, programs already have. Some even have an 
option to transmit when the Enter key is pressed. The PROBLEM  is that 
the frequency is  occupied, whether or not anyone is currently sending. 
That is the purpose of transmitting the QRL and waiting for a reply.

Media Access Control depends upon control of access, but on the ham 
bands, access is random, and not controllable. Our method of &quot;control&quot; 
is listening first, or the QRL,  and courteous operating practices. This 
is the way that we SHARE frequencies to make most efficient use of them 
by a lot of stations which may fade in and out. If you can control 
access then you can share resources, but if access by a central control 
is not possible, then we must rely on the human brain to control access. 
Heck, when I worked at Western Electric 50 years ago, we were given a 
demonstration of multiplexing over the phone lines, and what happened if 
too many users tried to get on at the same time - everyone's syllables 
were clipped. Of course, this is all covered by queuing theory, as you 
point out by the cell phone access control.

If you can design a mode that does better than what we have today, then 
do it! I assure you it will be welcomed and you can show us all how it 
should be done properly!
