Once I have that I can layer the MAC and the routing. Oh, and it will 
support kbd-to-kbd. My problem is that, while I am quite good with 
protocols, I don't have the signal processing and coding background. 
That was all phy stuff that was done by someone else. But once someone 
gave me a path to move bits from here to there, then I could make them 
sit up and beg. Now I want to understand the phy so I can get it right.

Sounds good, Brian. Fldigi is open source, so all the signal processing 
code you need is freely available, and I am sure there are others with 
the necessary background that will be glad to work together with you to 
produce a new mode that outperforms what we have now. As Nike says, 
&quot;Just do it&quot;! :-)

BTW, the number of variations of Olivia are very great, but the number 
of variables in propagation are also very great. It is just not possible 
to fine tune Olivia or Contestia for the maximum performance for any 
given set of conditions, because conditions are so variable, so we can 
only take a stab at it and use what appear to be the most promising 
variations and fully test those. For example, Dave has included in 
fldigi the means of experimenting with the interleaving for Contestia as 
well as custom combinations of baud rate and bandwidth for any given 
speed, so you can imagine how hard it is to form an opinion because it 
takes several weeks of daily tests for each combination to find which 
one works the best.

I was unable to copy KP4AO's Arecibo reflections off the moon today with 
my 16 dBi antenna, but some others in the states, even with a little 
less gain, found the signal strong (S3-S5) and others found it very, 
very, weak. It is the same moon, but perhaps the reflections from the 
surface favor one area of the country and not another. Not sure. The 
Europeans seem to have done better than others too. Unfortunately, the 
advertised ability to work KP4AO with a 100 watts and a hand-held yagi 
pointed at the moon just did not happen! Again, it is probably a case of 
too many variables on which to base a conclusion or reliable prediction.

Looking forward to your new mode!:-)
