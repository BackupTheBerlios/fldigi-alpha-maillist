&gt;<i> Media Access Control depends upon control of access,

Yeah, that is what its name implies. :-)


&gt;<i> but on the ham bands, access is random, and not controllable.
</I>

Why? You don't even need everyone participating for it to work. And don't
stop with thinking that your MAC just controls *when* you transmit but also
*where* (frequency) you transmit and maybe even *how* you transmit.

Our method of &quot;control&quot; is listening first, or the QRL,  and courteous
&gt;<i> operating practices.
</I>

So? That is CSMA.


&gt;<i> This is the way that we SHARE frequencies to make most efficient use of
</I>&gt;<i> them by a lot of stations which may fade in and out.
</I>

Statistical heuristic on CSMA.

If you can control access then you can share resources, but if access by a
&gt;<i> central control is not possible, then we must rely on the human brain to
</I>&gt;<i> control access.
</I>

Why? Do you have any idea just how complex distributed control is in the
Internet and the cell phone systems? There is no central control. Yet it
works very well with many orders of magnitude more complexity than what we
are talking about here.

If you think about it, what we do as human media access control computers is
actually very algorithmic. I bet you could write down the steps you use to
find a frequency and operate. But given the power of the computers we have
there is no reason why we can't automate that process.

Here is an example of how traditional thinking skews the process. You
probably think that if a station tunes to a different frequency and you
don't know it, you aren't going to receive their query about whether the
frequency is in use. But now think about CW skimmer and the PSK browser. We
have the ability to receive and decode an ENTIRE BAND at once. We can see
when a frequency is occupied and when it isn't. We can be frequency and time
agile. Why should an entire QSO take place on a single frequency? Why not
adaptively QSY? Why not beacon, &quot;we are going to be using this frequency for
this long.&quot;


&gt;<i> Heck, when I worked at Western Electric 50 years ago, we were given a
</I>&gt;<i> demonstration of multiplexing over the phone lines, and what happened if too
</I>&gt;<i> many users tried to get on at the same time - everyone's syllables were
</I>&gt;<i> clipped. Of course, this is all covered by queuing theory, as you point out
</I>&gt;<i> by the cell phone access control.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yeah. They have the problem with blocking because they required a 64kbps
channel. But look at the Internet. The more people who use it, it just
degrades gradually for everyone. Still, the traffic gets through.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you can design a mode that does better than what we have today, then do
</I>&gt;<i> it! I assure you it will be welcomed and you can show us all how it should
</I>&gt;<i> be done properly!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I am considering doing just that. Step one is to investigate the medium and
how to build an efficient adaptive link that runs over that medium. It may
run as slowly as a few bits-per-second, or as fast as several thousand bps
depending on band conditions. It will not require the operator to make that
decision.

Once I have that I can layer the MAC and the routing. Oh, and it will
support kbd-to-kbd. My problem is that, while I am quite good with
protocols, I don't have the signal processing and coding background. That
was all phy stuff that was done by someone else. But once someone gave me a
path to move bits from here to there, then I could make them sit up and beg.
Now I want to understand the phy so I can get it right.

But right now I am trying to get you guys to stop thinking in the same path.
Radios are changing. These changes bring about capabilities we have only
just dreamed of. Now they are here. We need to start thinking about taking
advantage of them.
