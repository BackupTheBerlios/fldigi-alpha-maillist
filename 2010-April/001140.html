<PRE>On UHF, comparisons between Olivia 8-250 and Olivia 16-500 have shown 
that Olivia 16-500 survives the Doppler effects better than the more 
narrow Olivia 8-250 (lower error rate), so we now use Contestia 16-500 
on UHF all the time, since it is twice as fast as Olivia 16-500, has a 
lower error rate than Olivia 8-250, and bandwidth is not at a premium on 
UHF. This also is after daily tests over more than a month, under all 
sorts of adverse conditions.

On our VHF FM simplex ragchew net, we use DominoEx 8 for our 
twice-weekly net as it reaches more weak stations than even MT63-1000 
can, and handles multipath very well. DominoEx 8 works well for stations 
over a 35 mile radius where many signals are far under limiting, and is 
reasonably fast. Because we are ragchewing, and not passing traffic, the 
speed of MT63-2000 is not needed, but the better weak signal performance 
of DominoEx is very badly needed.

For weak signal FM dxing, DominoEX 4 on FM works as well as SSB phone. 
If you can copy a station on SSB phone, you can switch to FM with the 
same antenna and power, and the error rate will be approximately the 
same. This means that operators that only have an FM transceiver can 
also work the same distances as SSB phone stations, if they can find 
another station using FM.

We have tried every available mode, over and over, and find that 
Contestia on UHF and DominoEx on VHF FM simplex work the best for us for 
casual operating.
