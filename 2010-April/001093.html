Please do not do this. The correct position is 1500-2300 Hz, right where it
is now; that is what the station is broadcasting. This puts the signal
exactly where it should be in the audio bandwidth, and further, should other
gear be hooked up (such as external fax hardware and fax audio filters), it
will work properly. Also, synchronous recordings will work for playback
later and with other gear.

Some observations:

Bug: I set max lines to 2000; let manual run; when it reset to auto, the
widgets wrote text over the first line of fax controls, at the right end. A
little confusion as to which widget is active at that time, perhaps.

Operational issue: In manual, it resets into auto mode when the max lines
complete. It should stay in manual unless I take it out.

Also, in manual, rather than abort, I suggest it go to STOP, where it isn't
receiving at all, just paused. As it is, the image immediately erases and if
not saving, you never get to look at it.

Feature suggestion that will help with weaker signals in auto: Protect
against APT-end until a certain number of lines have been received (probably
should be user-settable... default to maybe 1000 or so.) Otherwise, in weak
signal conditions, the receive often quits very early, interpreting noise as
&quot;stop.&quot; It would be nice to even disable APT-end, as once reception is
begun, even horribly weak signals can be somewhat copied, but that APT-end
will probably kill the fax under those conditions.

Possible bug: I set up my slant (now -.005), ran the wefax mode for a while,
then quit fldigi using the menu, during receive. My slant setting was not
restored when I restarted;

Operational issue: The wefax display window, which was open when I quit, and
did not re-open when I re-started fldigi. My feeling is that it should. If
you're in wefax mode and the window is open when you quit, that's how it
should restart. IMHO.

Lost data bug: It still loses receive data when you re-size the window. It
acts like the thread that manages the window is the one that is capturing
the data? Just guessing... but the hole in the image is very noticeable.
