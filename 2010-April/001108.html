</I>I have noticed this, sometimes. I suspect this is related to a REQ event 
being lost. I made a fix to correct it by hiding the redundant menu 
(Available in next commit&#176; and did not see the problem happen again.

 &gt; A little confusion as to which widget is active at that time, perhaps.
Yes, this is why the window label will indicate  the manual/auto mode.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Operational issue: In manual, it resets into auto mode when the max 
</I>&gt;<i> lines complete. It should stay in manual unless I take it out.
</I>Yes, well done. Fix will be available in next commit to pu/rc.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, in manual, rather than abort, I suggest it go to STOP, where it 
</I>&gt;<i> isn't receiving at all, just paused. As it is, the image immediately 
</I>&gt;<i> erases and if not saving, you never get to look at it.
</I>Yes, I feel the same need. The plan is to suppress the button 'Hide' 
because it does exactly what closing the window does (By cliking the 
cross at the upper right corner). This button Hide is therefore 
redundant, and it is quite ergonomic to replace it by 'Pause/Restart' 
just as you suggest. This way, I do not touch 'Abort' so I am sure not 
to add any bug, nor to displease people who like it.

It will be available in next commit.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Feature suggestion that will help with weaker signals in auto: Protect 
</I>&gt;<i> against APT-end until a certain number of lines have been received 
</I>&gt;<i> (probably should be user-settable... default to maybe 1000 or so.) 
</I>&gt;<i> Otherwise, in weak signal conditions, the receive often quits very 
</I>&gt;<i> early, interpreting noise as &quot;stop.&quot; It would be nice to even disable 
</I>&gt;<i> APT-end, as once reception is begun, even horribly weak signals can be 
</I>&gt;<i> somewhat copied, but that APT-end will probably kill the fax under 
</I>&gt;<i> those conditions.
</I>What about a small tick to disable Apt-End detection, displayed only 
when in auto mode ?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Possible bug: I set up my slant (now -.005), ran the wefax mode for a 
</I>&gt;<i> while, then quit fldigi using the menu, during receive. My slant 
</I>&gt;<i> setting was not restored when I restarted;
</I>Yes, this is right. At the moment, I do not know how to save settings, 
and we decided more or less not to add a 'wefax modem' tab to the modem 
settings, due to the apparent complexity to change the 'fluid-generated' 
fltk menus, and postpone these changes.

So, if there is a way to save these settings without using fluid, I will 
be happy to do it. Otherwise, I would prefer to postpone it until we 
will know the entire list of parameters to set in this modem menu.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Operational issue: The wefax display window, which was open when I 
</I>&gt;<i> quit, and did not re-open when I re-started fldigi. My feeling is that 
</I>&gt;<i> it should. If you're in wefax mode and the window is open when you 
</I>&gt;<i> quit, that's how it should restart. IMHO.
</I>Someone also suggested that when entering any wefax mode, the reception 
window should open. It corroborates the fact that a couple of users when 
entering this mode, simply did not know what to do until suggested to go 
to 'View'. My problem here is the same: How to save a user setting 
without using the modem menus?
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Lost data bug: It still loses receive data when you re-size the 
</I>&gt;<i> window. It acts like the thread that manages the window is the one 
</I>&gt;<i> that is capturing the data? Just guessing... but the hole in the image 
</I>&gt;<i> is very noticeable.
</I>Yes again. I would like to know whether it is possible to lose events in 
REQ. My plan is to temporarily replace REQ by REQ_SYNC.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>To summarize, we need some clarification about what are the clean ways 
to save user settings in fldigi, without having to change modem menus.

Thanks for your ideas and remarks.

Cheers

Remi
