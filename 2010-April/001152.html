<PRE>I'll venture to throw another philosophical hat into the ring here.

First of all, if you really want noise-free communications, there's the
Internet. Between VHF -- almost noise free for short (70 mi or so, sometimes
more) haul -- and then transition to the net -- noise-free -- the means to
directly talk to people is pretty much there for an enormous number of
situations. In fact, it strikes me as interesting why there isn't an easily
used automatic bi-directional radio-network link mechanism if the object is
emergency communication. If the answer to that is along the lines of &quot;the
FCC&quot; (I dunno, is it? There are packet-to-Internet gateways, why not
something like that in fldigi?), then I say to heck with 'em, they obviously
don't *want* emergency communications unless they have their snotty little
mittens on them.

Secondly, for me (this is all from my POV, doesn't invalidate anyone else's,
and part of the reason I'm writing this is to encourage opinions to the
contrary, as well as having mine heard) a great deal of the charm is in what
the atmosphere does to any particular signal. bands of noise on fax, missing
chunks of rtty... yeah, rtty's a horrible performer when the s/n goes south
compared to many other modes, but it's *radio*, and that's why I'm using
it... because it's charming and interesting and even intriguing when the
atmosphere does its happy ionospheric dance. Same reason auroras are
interesting to me, pictures of clouds, etc... the randomness and its effects
on my pursuits has actual charm.

Thoid, WRT rx quality of any particular mode+CODEC, once we know it works as
designed in good conditions, speaking again of HF-like conditions, we still
know that there will be conditions in which it does not work -- because
there are conditions under which zero signal reaches the receiver. So this
is a problem that in the end, one really cannot fix (though again, I point
at VHF and the Internet as a confluence of technologies that can serve
almost any imaginable disaster that the planet can survive. With (at least)
70 mi of dependable radio link range (presuming yagis and some reasonable
vantage point), ignoring satellites, you've got 140 linear miles between
hard net interfaces and everything will still work... and a covered area,
per net-connected station, of 30,000 sq miles. Enough to keep ya busy, I'm
sure. :)

I used to routinely work stations well over 200 miles out, because I'm on
the plains and there are some very handy repeaters up on mountain tops I can
hit at about a range of 140 miles from here. That's quality distance for
VHF. OTOH, those repeaters are on top of a volcano (Zortman), so... :)

I fully recognize that it is fun to work on new modes. I designed some of
the SSTV modes that are out there now, and yeah, they're a heck of a lot
more noise resistant and likely to make it through in poor conditions than
the others - using less bandwidth, same data rate, but conveying the same
information much more reliably, I might add - and that was why I coded them
up. It's all manner of fun to &quot;do it better.&quot;

But I *don't* think this in any way creates a situation where lower
performance modes (RTTY, 8-second BW SSTV, CW, etc.) should be considered to
have lost their charm. That just strikes me as snotty.

When you start talking about the channel being full, and the number of
operators on it... the only time that seems to happen is during contests,
the very least interesting time for me to turn the radio on under the sun.
There's nothing I look forward to less in amateur radio than a contest. It
means I'll be out rock collecting, or something on that order.

Now, if the bands were full of hams doing this and that (other than
contests)... but they aren't, and they never have been, at least since I
started listening (1960 or so.) So it's back (for me) to the charm of the
thing. QSOs about technical things; antennas and radios and digital whackery
(like these very discussions); actually passing info about where you live to
someone who lives elsewhere; beating each other over the head with superior
(for the moment) weather conditions... you know, discussions with high
*data* s/n, that leave one feeling stimulated and perhaps even informed. As
opposed to contests, which carry no useful data at all, again from my POV.

Anyway, let's not throw RTTY out with the bathwater, shall we? Bad enough
the bloody news services did it. By all means, make more and better modes,
experiment to see what works best (and then try something brand new) but
let's just not forget the amateur nature of this, and the radio-riffic charm
of everything from CW onward.

A while ago, I suggested the idea that for RTTY, it'd be fun to have the
received text on &quot;paper&quot; that had ragged edges, coffee rings, etc. That
suggestion was about the charm of it all. I wouldn't mind a sound effect
channel either, that performed a 5-level/shift kerchunking like an old
Baudot teletype. Be an interesting adjunct to those &quot;now, when I was a kid&quot;
stories. Just as a tube radio is still interesting, you see? Well, perhaps
you don't. But for me, charm is a hugely important part of this whole thing.
When the charm goes away, so will I.

So there's my hat. Ugly old thing, isn't it?
