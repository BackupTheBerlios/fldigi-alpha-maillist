</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Brian,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We again tested DominoEx against Contestia on UHF today with the customary
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Doppler disturbance and DominoEx 8 did poorly, but Contestia had perfect
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> copy.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now, did you do a fair and accurate comparison? Did you turn on FEC?
</I>&gt;<i> DominoEX without FEC is, frankly, not useful in a path dominated by flutter
</I>&gt;<i> and doppler. Turn on FEC on DominoEX or, better still, compare Contestia to
</I>&gt;<i> Thor, which is DominoEX with FEC done properly. I think you will find the
</I>&gt;<i> difference less apparent.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you are interested in *why* you are seeing the results you are, see
</I>&gt;<i> this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://homepage.mac.com/chen/Technical/DominoEX/Measurements/">http://homepage.mac.com/chen/Technical/DominoEX/Measurements/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And specifically this graph:

</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://homepage.mac.com/chen/Technical/DominoEX/ITU/ITU/flutter.html">http://homepage.mac.com/chen/Technical/DominoEX/ITU/ITU/flutter.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Notice the very high error rate of DominoEX in the presence of flutter with
</I>&gt;<i> FEC turned off and the HUGE improvement with it turned on. This is a real
</I>&gt;<i> analysis of the characteristics of the protocols. This is the kind of thing
</I>&gt;<i> that needs to be done in order to find what works best.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is really Really *REALLY* important to understand what is going on with
</I>&gt;<i> these protocols in the presence of propagation anomalies in order to be able
</I>&gt;<i> to make decisions about which modes work best under what conditions. My own
</I>&gt;<i> recent experiments in monitoring and graphing the phase/frequency changes of
</I>&gt;<i> the WWV carrier over time (20-30 minute samples typically) have convinced me
</I>&gt;<i> that sequential testing of protocols, i.e. transmitting a message and then
</I>&gt;<i> immediately transmitting the same message using the other protocol, is not
</I>&gt;<i> likely to produce valid results unless repeated numerous times and then the
</I>&gt;<i> results averaged with outliers discarded. I have been pestering Dave to do a
</I>&gt;<i> test version of fldigi that would let me transmit the same data in two modes
</I>&gt;<i> at the same time in the same passband so that both experience *exactly* the
</I>&gt;<i> same propagation conditions concurrently. *THAT* will let us see which one
</I>&gt;<i> works better, especially if it can report the channel conditions for fading
</I>&gt;<i> (slow amplitude change), flutter (rapid amplitude change), multipath (rapid
</I>&gt;<i> phase change and selective fading), and doppler (slow steady phase/frequency
</I>&gt;<i> change).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Digital data transmission over HF and NLOS VHF/UHF is an area ripe for
</I>&gt;<i> analysis and experimentation. Right now in this area hams have the ability
</I>&gt;<i> to be out in front again as they were through the 1950's. The only person I
</I>&gt;<i> know of who is doing meaningful work in this area is Kok Chen, W7AY. He
</I>&gt;<i> assures me that there are a few others but, frankly, I haven't met them. And
</I>&gt;<i> I say meaningful in that he has come up with a means of testing in a
</I>&gt;<i> controlled, simulated environment as a first pass in determining what we
</I>&gt;<i> think we should see if we truly understand what is going on. The next step
</I>&gt;<i> is to repeat that testing in the real world over live paths but in a
</I>&gt;<i> strictly controlled manner so that we can extract real performance data.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So building a bunch of digital modes is nice and very useful but now we
</I>&gt;<i> need to go the next step and use the tools in a scientific way to extract
</I>&gt;<i> better understanding.  (Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't be here pondering
</I>&gt;<i> this if it weren't for Dave's and Stelios' work in producing fldigi with all
</I>&gt;<i> these modes with which to experiment.) Time to take the next step and build
</I>&gt;<i> on Chen's work by getting real, controlled data from live propagation.
