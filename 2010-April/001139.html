<PRE>I think the distinction needs to be made between passing traffic and a 
QSO. No matter how fast a typist you may be, or how fast the mode is, 
unless you &quot;typeahead&quot; at a furious rate, the amount of time spent 
typing thoughts, or during changeovers, is the same if the mode is 50 
wpm or 250 wpm.

The other problem is that wide modes &quot;tend&quot; to have a poorer minimum S/N 
than more narrow modes. I am not sure why this is true, but it is for 
almost all the modes at our disposal. Double the speed, and you double 
the bandwidth, but require two times better S/N. Perhaps if a wide mode 
were designed that effectively used all the bandwidth as effectively as 
a more narrow mode, this would not be true. There is probably 
communications theory to tell if this is possible.

Just suppose all the PSK31 operators switched to Contestia, which works 
better than PSK31 under adverse conditions. There probably would not be 
enough space on HF to handle all the QSO's now on PSK31. Sure, there 
would be less fills or errors, but many people are satisfied with the 
PSK31 performance. However, there is a case to be made for using Olivia 
or Contestia 16-500 (30 wpm in Contestia or 15 wpm in Olivia) - 
communication is simply possible when it is impossible using PSK31, for 
example on UHF where Doppler effects make PSK31 totally unusable, or 
over the polar path.

There were 3 S-units of enhancement two days ago on our UHF path, and 
very little Doppler, so we tried PSK125R. No problem at all, and no 
errors, but you type for a minute and it all goes out in a few seconds, 
and then you wait for the other station to type for a minute, etc.! It 
is just essential to define the purpose of communication - is it for 
passing traffic as quickly as possible, or is it for conversation? The 
choice of mode and speed depends upon the path and purpose and there is 
no clear choice that fits all.

For us on UHF, we find that Contestia is every bit as good as Olivia, 
but twice as fast (at 30 wpm) when Olivia seems painfully slow for 
comfortable conversation at only 15 wpm. I touch-type at only about 35 
wpm, and if I make a typo, many times there is time for me to backspace 
and make a correction just before the letters are sent out, so Contestia 
is a good &quot;fit&quot; for me - sensitive, fast enough, and resilient to the 
rough conditions we have on UHF. Olivia might be a better &quot;fit&quot; for 
others and have both upper and lower cases. BTW, in the latest fldigi, 
there is an option to print incoming text in all lower case, which some 
find easier to read for conversation than all upper case. Transmission 
is converted to all upper case, of course.
