True, and I seriously doubt that anyone has bothered to do that.

This is somewhat more complex than it sounds... what would work right
now would be to generate two audio files (with signals at suitable
frequencies of course) and mix them using another program.  I'm sure sox
can do that in one short command line.

In fact if fldigi had xmlrpc methods to start/stop audio file
generation, it would be easy to write a script to do an audio file for
each mode (for a particular input text), and then you could mix them as
needed for your tests.  I guess I'll need to write those xmlrpc methods
first :-)

Some comparisons have been posted to the digitalradio yahoo group.
There is one by K2MO, and another by WZ7I.  URL for the latter:

  <A HREF="http://mysite.verizon.net/wz7i/digitalmodes.html">http://mysite.verizon.net/wz7i/digitalmodes.html</A>

The tests done by K2MO are in the files area of digitalradio, and he has
posted them to the group a few times too.

I can't say how scientific those experiments were, but I know that the
path simulator used (pathsim) is GPL'ed so at least that aspect of the
tests can be verified by anyone so inclined.

ES1HJ also has published some test results but I don't recall if they
were on-air or simulation tests.
