</I>Great!! Thanks for the report. 

BSD and Mac left. 

BTW - the program will have a help file and other features included in
it once I find out it is working under all platforms.

The output should look like this:

*2018 04/25/2010 ka1vgm ID:n/a Surry,NH
TEMP: 50F
WIND: NW 4MPH   GUST: 6MPH
PRESSURE:  --
SKY COVER: OVERCAST
PRECIPITATION: RAIN  TOTAL: 1.25&quot;
REPORTING METHOD: MEASURED
COMMENTS: Testing the nws program.*


It is in a format that our NWS office likes to see the information
presented.

I am trying to model it after the flics program, but without adding the
extra overhead of all of the ICS form fields.

The NWS office can leave a computer on with fldigi listening on the
local repeater (they listen for voice contacts anyway) and collect all
of these reports.
They can (or i can) create a program or script to parse the data as they
see fit.

Of course I suggest you MUST use flwrap to verify correct reception.
