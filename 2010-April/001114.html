<PRE>If you are running OS X 10.6.3 (Snow Leopard) we would like to hear from 
you regarding fldigi stability on your computer.  Have you had any 
problems with program stall or shutdown, particularly in the Olivia mode?

Thanks, Dave, W1HKJ

Dave,
 
Last night I ran the windows version of fldigi 3.20.0bA and all was as 
expected; everything worked well and stable.
I went back to the OS-X environment that was stable the previous evening 
and now it again seems to be unstable, but I can't really find any 
reason for this behaviour.
 
I was looking into some of the data that the build info presents. There 
may be an issue that the Xcode libraries might not be up to date on the 
build machine. The build info indicates the OS name is &quot;darwin&quot;, which I 
beleive is OS-X 10.4. I am running OSX 10.6.3 (Snow Leopard&quot;) which 
might be incorrectly linked if complied on &quot;darwin&quot;. I am not 100% sure, 
but there may be some who are running the older OSX 10.5 (&quot;Leopard&quot;) 
which might not have issues with the older Xcode libs. I on the other 
hand am running the latest and most up to date OSX. this would seem to 
point me to setting up the build environment on my machine to create the 
static linked versions for OSX 10.6.3.
 
Like I said earlier, I am not the software guru, so setting it up to 
build from source is going to take me some time.
 
I have been wondering if my system could have some errant code floating 
around in the user interfaces that is causing these random closures.
If there were an easy way to rebuild the machine, I would have done it 
already. It just does not make any sense to me that only one program 
would have this behavior. I have to beleive that there is some unique 
combination of conditions that is creating this issue or there is some 
coding problem we just can't  get our hands around.
 
 I want to get back to being a functional load, but this is really 
upsetting.
 
Let me know how you think we should proceed.

Thanks,

Mitch Baum / AF2M
