<PRE>Being a former beekeeper for 34 years I just had to do some research on 
the subject.
==========================

      What is the origin of the phrase 'the bee's knees', and what
      exactly does it mean?

The /Oxford English Dictionary/ records the expression / bee's knee/ as 
meaning the type of something small or insignificant from 1797. The 
plural form is US slang dating from the 1920s, when there was an 
explosion of terms meaning 'the acme of excellence': compare /the cat's 
whiskers/pyjamas/. The first example is dated 1923. Some of these have 
lasted, and some have not (/the flea's eyebrows, the canary's tusks/).

      *&quot;the bee's knees&quot;(Phrase Origins)*

A bee's &quot;corbiculae&quot;, or pollen-baskets, are located on its tibiae 
(midsegments of its legs). The phrase &quot;the bee's knees&quot;, meaning &quot;the 
height of excellence&quot;, became popular in the U.S. in the 1920s, along 
with &quot;the cat's whiskers&quot; (possibly from the use of these in radio 
crystal sets), &quot;the cat's pajamas&quot; (pyjamas were still new enough to be 
daring), and similar phrases which made less sense and didn't endure: 
&quot;the eel's ankle&quot;, &quot;the elephant's instep&quot;, &quot;the snake's hip&quot;. Stories 
in circulation about the phrase's origin include: &quot;b's and e's&quot;, short 
for &quot;be-alls and end-alls&quot;; and a corruption of &quot;business&quot;.

Source: [Mark Israel, 'Phrase Origins: &quot;the bee's knees&quot;', The 
alt.usage.english FAQ file,(line 4407) &lt;<A HREF="http://www.english-usage.com/">http://www.english-usage.com/</A>&gt;, 
(29 Sept 1997)]

Beekeepers usually consider the corbiculae, or pollen baskets as a 
reference to the  broad hairy regions of the female worker bees rear 
legs.  The pollen load can at time exceed the weight of the bee and yet 
it still manages to fly.  Amazing little insects.  I miss the smell of 
the hive.  The absolutely best image I could find for the corbiculae is 
here:

Stelios is working on the bees-knees of ID cornucopia.  You will be able 
to specify by mode, by Tx and by Rx, whether or not RSID encoding / 
decoding occurs, and by mode whether or not CW / VIDEO encoding occurs.
