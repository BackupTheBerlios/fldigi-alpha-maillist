<PRE>
Does fldigi have the capability of sending a CW ID at appropriate
intervals while send a file using one of the various modes?  I've
looked through the manual and see no reference to it.

Several weeks ago, I was the net control and exercise coordinator
for our Colorado HF digital net.  I chose to send a zipped,
uuencoded file that started out as a .doc ICS-213 document..
(I know, ICS-213 as a .doc is NOT efficient, but I wanted to
see just how well everyone would receive it).

The file was pretty long, as files sent over HF go, 5951 bytes.
I used MT63, 500 Hz bandwidth as the net is conducted on 80M
where there is not much room.  Actually it would not be a problem
in the early morning hours where there is not much activity,
but I like to be as realistic as I can with our exercises.
I don't see us using 1000 or 2000 Hz bandwidth on 80M in
the evening hours.

Anyway, it became obvious to me that it was taking way over
10 minutes to send the file, so I aborted the transmission.

So have I missed it in the help pages or is there no way
to do an automatic CW ID at given intervals (like TNCs will do)?

Thanks and 73,

Mike, K0TER
