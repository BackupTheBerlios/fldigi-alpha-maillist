The following are some After Action Notes for alpha version users:

The macro setup outlined by W3NR using the &lt;XOUT&gt; worked really nice.

I would still like a contest hand brake to prevent me from flipping the
macro sets. This was less of a problem in this contest as I used Dave's
tip and tried to avoid using mouse scroll wheel.

Half way into the contest I changed from fldigi-3.13BG to new 3.13BL
(OS X version) with no issues at all.

The RFI issues I experienced in other contests was solved by new Christmas
present from my daughter.  I got rid of the mouse cord by using the new
Apple (Bluetooth) Magic Mouse and that solved the RFI issue.

I really liked and used the fldigi Contest Short Menu
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.w1hkj.com/FldigiHelp/Logbook.html">http://www.w1hkj.com/FldigiHelp/Logbook.html</A>&gt;
for this contest as it made capturing of the received exchange easy.

When I started having trouble selecting (mousing) calls, it was helpful to
clear the received text pane.  The fldigi team decision to include the broom
in the Short Menu was a good idea and I used the broom to clear the
received pane from time to time.

The fldigi Cabrillo export worked; however, I did have to do some minor
tweaking with a text editor to ditch some extra lines where I hit the log
button by mistake and logged several blank QSOs.

The only item someone my want to check was most of the logged reports
in the saved Cabrillo txt file had two spaces between the 599 and the
received report.  It was more of a cosmetic thing as the contest robot
would most likely ignore the extra space.  The sent 599 TX lined up and
looked good.

I was very impressed when the saved Cabrillo report was accepted by the
ARRL contest robot with no issues and the ARRL tqsl signed the same file
for me to upload to the LoTW robot.

My thanks to Dave W1HKJ and the fldigi development team for the contest
options included in fldigi.
