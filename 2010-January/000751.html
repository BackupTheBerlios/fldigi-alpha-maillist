<PRE>Background.
Band conditions in the UK on Thursday evening were bad during our
monthly Raynet HF non voice net with so we resorted to 160 M where I can
only receive at the moment.
So using the shout box on our web site G0DUB sent short tests using
various modes and sending RSID so I could test switching which seemed to
work fairly well given the band conditions.
Problem.
As I had made a recording I played it back later and did not see any
RSID notifications or switching. The few psk31 tests showed up OK in the
viewer and the other modes looked OK in the waterfall as far as I could
see.
Before going further I will ask the obvious question.
Is RSID supposed to work when playing back a recording.
This was version BS by the way.
