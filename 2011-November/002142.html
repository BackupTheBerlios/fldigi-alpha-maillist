<PRE>I had an unusual logging experience with fldigi-3.21.26.  I checked the T2T online log and it showed a QSO with AA5VU for 15 meter digital.  I remembered working T2T (Tuvalu) on RTTY; however, the QSL was not in my fldigi logbook. At the time I assumed I must have forgot to push the &lt;LOG&gt; macro.   

The next day I decided to work the T2T operation again and this time I made sure I clicked on the log button.  To double-check I opened the logbook using the Logbook/View menu item and the second T2T QSO was not logged.  At this point I moused on the File/Folders/Fldigi config option and nothing happened. It did not open my .fldigi folder.  Fldigi was decoding perfect but some of the other command options were not functioning.

I quit and restarted fldig and that did not help.  I then quit and restarted the iMac (OS X 10.7.2) and fldigi seems to be working normal again. I then manually entered the QSO and fldigi logged it but I had to edit the QSO time. I have no idea what caused some of the fldigi functions to be sleeping-on-the-job.  This may be a Mac OS X only issue.

Now that I think about it, I ran into this same situation some time ago in a contest where I logged QSO's but the SN's got all screwed up because some numbers and QSO were skipped or not logged.

I have learned (the hard way) to keep the logbook open while contesting or working DX to be sure the &lt;LOG&gt; macro really saves the QSO.

Ps: The T2T QSO (with Jay W5SL) is now in my fldigi log for a new RTTY country.
