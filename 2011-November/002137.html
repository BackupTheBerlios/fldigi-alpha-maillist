<PRE>Hi Paul and Dick,
I have the same issue with this command as Paul has got, my log being 23000 or so. I run fldigi on WXP with an AMD dual core. In my case it takes up to 3 secs. For this reason I have taken out all &lt;log&gt; macros and do it manually when I finish a QSO. Question to our brilliant programmers: why can't this macro be executed at the real end of the transmission, rather than at the beginning?

Paul VE9NC,

I tried and cannot duplicate the issue you described.  I use the &lt;LOG&gt; macro for 
daily QSOs as well as contests and have never noticed the delay you mentioned
on this iMac using OS X 10.7.2.  

Do you have the same delay when you save to &quot;new&quot; logbook or is the delay
unique to your logbook with 30K of QSO's.
