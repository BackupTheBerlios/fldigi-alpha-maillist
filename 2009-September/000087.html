</I>Dick If the first picture is supposed to be the actual state when you
open the rig tab then RigCAT is not the active tab as the use RigCAT box
is not checked.

I just checked with the last release version and it always opens at
Hamlib even though I use RigCAT.
If you close and re-open the tab it seems to open at what ever tab was
last displayed but shutting down fldigi and restarting always gives the
Hamlib tab when the Rig tab is selected.
Maybe from the cries for help on the lists Dave has changed the default
as there has been more success in getting RigCAT to work.
I guess if you open the rig tab for the very first time you would try
what was offered first. Yes I know some people would be perverse and try
anything but ;-)

I'm waiting on confirmation that my phone line is really fixed so am
staying away from downloads or I would have got the latest alpha.
The stated fix date is today but it was working when I got home
yesterday. But the sms update from the phone company say the still hope
to fix it today.
