&gt;<i> Version 3.13AG
</I>

This is more fun than I've had with fldigi in a long time. Actually
managed to lock down the whole desktop.

1. I see no way to change the stop bits with the Omni6 in hamlib. Its
set to 2. Although hamlib works just fine.

2. I had to tweak the timing in rigcat, but not hamlib. Write delay
went from 20 to 10.

3. When I first started to work with hamlib, the &quot;rig not responding&quot;
error showed up as I had selected the wrong com port.

4. Then I got the sound server time out that Rick K9AO had talked about
previously. This was right after I had selected the correct comport for
hamlib and clicked the initialize button.

5. Had to killall to close fldigi, but the whole desktop had quit
responding. Finally cleared all of that.

6. Restarted fldig and the ARQ server error showed as well as the sound
server timeout.

7. Interesting that portaudio was showing pulse as a selection. Also
told me the sample rate was incorrect.

8.Just gave up and rebooted, had to reselect /dev/dsp for sound as it
had been cleared as a choice from #4.

9. I noticed just a slight hestitation in the frequency gui as a roll
the mouse wheel. But it depends on the speed.

10. QRZ lookup still works just fine here. Ubuntu 9.04


Need to see if I can break it anymore.
