Thanks Stelios, I've used that technique so many times I forgot that it 
was there!

Instead of the ^t you could also the default F9 macro to start the 
transmit.  And oh yes,  that is not a control-r that you enter in to the 
text.  It is the carat followed by the r.  The transmit is control-t as 
Stelios points out.

A variation on the above is to create multiple macro lines where each 
has a line of text followed by the ^r, as in:

&quot;this is a line of text
^r&quot;

Note the newline between text and ^r ... makes it easier to read.

Then simply press the macro key(s) for those lines and send each with a 
new control-t.

Another variation would be to create a single macro with all of the text 
lines that need to be sent one at a time

this is line 1^r
this is line 2^r
this is line 3^r
...
this is line N^r

The transmit process is again the same.

For interactive line by line you will need to use the technique that 
Stelios outlined.
