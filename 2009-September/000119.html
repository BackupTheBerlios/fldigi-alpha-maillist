<PRE>Hi,
before there is raised dust about &quot;I want this new mode&quot; and &quot;no, I want that instead&quot;, may I propose some kind of poll in this group where there may be found some scale of preference ? This would enable Dave to consider the one or other implementation based on &quot;popular request&quot;.
Looking at my own logs of the past decade, in my view the modes in question are:

FSK 31- 62 - 125
JT65 + WSPR
RTTYM
CONTESTIA
CHIP 64 + 128
AMTOR FEC (as I believe that ARQ cannot be done on soundcard basis)
I could imagine that the emcomm mates would envisage ALE variants, too.

As known, there are many other modes but which are mostly unknown or simply unused, for whichever reasons, e.g. MFTTY, GMSK, PSK220F, C/D-Hell etc. 

We all know that about 90% of digital QSOs are done in BPSK, and that the majority of hams don't care about the fuzzier modes. They could do with Digipan, Zakanaka or Winwarbler, not needing the varieties already offered by fldigi, MixW, DM780, MMVari and Multipsk.
Yet, of the about 2,5 mio. hams worldwide there are about 10% who are interested and active. I find it a bit cumbersom having to quit one program and opening another just to work a stn calling cq in a mode I am interested in. We 10% need a bit more of mutual compatibility of modes. When using fldigi I want to run it all the time, not having to use WSJT7, Multipsk, DM780 or those of IZ8BLY in between.

Finally, some of the modes mentioned have advantages under difficult conditions, similar to Thor, Olivia and MFSK which we got already and I am grateful for.

Pse comment.
