<PRE>Gary,
I think you can do almost this with a macro key.:
 &lt;TX&gt;
 de &lt;MYCALL&gt;&lt;RX&gt;

The difference is that the text comes out before the &quot;de MYCALL&quot; rather 
than after.

Maybe Stelios could think of a macro to send hold off on sending the 
already buffered text, something like this:
 &lt;PUSH&gt;&lt;TX&gt;
 de &lt;MYCALL&gt;: &lt;POP&gt;
 &lt;RX&gt;

A macro might be better than a mode bceause it's often not obvious hot 
to get out of modes, unless it puts up something obvious like a dialog 
box which you can close.  That sounds like a lot of UI work.

&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> I just wanted to float this idea by everyone.  If it is of some 
</I>&gt;<i> interest, great.  If not, only a few digital bits wasted.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> While testing fldigi and flarq we found the flarq Plain Talk feature 
</I>&gt;<i> very handy.  It made coordinating our testing very easy.  We were 
</I>&gt;<i> running BPSK250.  For running flarq, high data rates are good.  
</I>&gt;<i> Hitting enter after typing a line of text causes flarq to send that 
</I>&gt;<i> line and switch back to receive.  It was similar to running vox on 
</I>&gt;<i> SSB.  When we screwed up and lost flarq Plain Talk communications, we 
</I>&gt;<i> would switch over to fldigi keyboard-to-keyboard operation.  After 
</I>&gt;<i> Plain Talk, that felt a bit clumsy.  Keyboard BPSK250 operation is a 
</I>&gt;<i> bit silly.  fldigi is screaming away sending the idle pattern while 
</I>&gt;<i> infrequently a keyboard character sneaks out.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> I don't suppose that idle time mattered for what we were doing but it 
</I>&gt;<i> brings up the idea I've had.  How about putting a feature in fldigi so 
</I>&gt;<i> that it could be switched to an operating mode where pressing the 
</I>&gt;<i> enter key causes what is in the transmit panel to be sent and then 
</I>&gt;<i> automatically drop back to receive.  This would allow a kind of Plain 
</I>&gt;<i> Talk operation within fldigi.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> What I have in mind for this is net operation.  Much of what goes on 
</I>&gt;<i> in a net is basically one line transmissions, or at least often should 
</I>&gt;<i> be, when real traffic is not being passed.  I am picturing net control 
</I>&gt;<i> having a few macros to run things while net check in could be done 
</I>&gt;<i> with short on/off transmissions.  Simple one liners in PSK250 take 
</I>&gt;<i> less time to transmit than it takes me to slide the mouse cursor to 
</I>&gt;<i> the transmit button.  Things run a little slower in other modes but 
</I>&gt;<i> mostly we will be running the fastest mode that provides reliable 
</I>&gt;<i> communications.  Whatever we can do to shorten needed transmission 
</I>&gt;<i> time during an active net should be an advantage.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> Transmission identification is an issue in this kind of operation.  
</I>&gt;<i> What I think would work best is for each of these Plain Talk style 
</I>&gt;<i> transmissions to start with an automatic header consisting of a CR/LF 
</I>&gt;<i> to start the text on the left side of the screen, the transmitting 
</I>&gt;<i> stations call sign, a colon, a space, and then the transmit buffer 
</I>&gt;<i> text.  It might sound a little cute to format a transmission like that 
</I>&gt;<i> but for minimizing transmission time for net operation with several 
</I>&gt;<i> stations on frequency, it might allow things to move along quickly.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, that is my thought.
</I>&gt;<i>
