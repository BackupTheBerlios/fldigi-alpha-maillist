Certainly that is how they are used much of the time but they do not
*require* the infrastructure to function. You can send and receive
email via a WinLink or SailMail station without that mail traversing
the Internet. And it should be possible to adapt the system to do
store-and-forward entirely via HF. I direct you to the venerable uucp
system if you wish to see an example of how that might work.

But you seem to be missing the point which is that we have an example
of a system that will establish a link, adapt the link to prevailing
conditions, and transfer information, all without humans fiddling with
it (for the most part). Yes a human on one end must initiate the
connection but even then it could be completely automated without too
much difficulty.

And please do not get me wrong -- I do *not* think that PACTOR +
AirMail represents the final endpoint in automated digital
communications over HF. I was simply pointing to PACTOR + Airmail as
an interesting experiment that has done a great deal in this area and
that it work surprisingly well despite its limitations. It is an
excellent springboard from which we can ask two key questions:

1. What does this system do well?

2. How can it be improved upon?
