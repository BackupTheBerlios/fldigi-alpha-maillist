<PRE>I think there is merit in the original idea, but I also believe that modes
that affect UI are hard to understand.  See
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_%28computer_interface%29">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_%28computer_interface%29</A>

So, while the macro button proposals provide the functionality, they don't
provide the ease-of-use that the original users seems to want.  To do that
without building in a mode would require a new window or dialog.

I think, as I said, that that idea has merit.  Think of it as a chat window.
You could have a menu item to bring it up, just like with the PSK Viewer
dialog, except that it would have a history buffer at the top and a
one-line typein area (to discourage long-windedness which translates to
dead air time).

Another enhancement: Many chat programs fill in dead air time by sending a
&quot;foobar is typing&quot; message.  This dialog could do the same; if there is no
RX sync and you're typing, every 15 seconds or so it could send &quot;de
WA5ZNU: &lt;AS&gt;&quot; which the receiving program would interpret at a signal to
display a &quot;typing&quot; icon and other hams reading on the air would recognize
as the CW &quot;AS&quot; prosign, to wait.  This would also prevent unintentional
QRM.  (Applying an CSMA-like exponential backoff algorithm would be
difficult though so it would be useful only in a QSO, not in a net, where
it would simply itself become QRM).

Another enhancement, maybe not worth it but an interesting
gedankenexperiment: bring the analogy with IM chat and the similarity to
PSK Viewer forward a step further and you could have multiple chat windows
open and do multiple simultaneous QSOS on different frequencies. The
half-duplex nature means it wouldn't work very well, but it's an
interesting thought and perhaps some further thought can lead to more
overlap with the PSK viewer window.

In summary, I can see a new dialog like the PSK Viewer, but with a big
text RX buffer, a single line input, and no TX button (maybe a STOP
button, maybe a signal quality green bar), and maybe a &quot;someone is typing&quot;
icon that lights up (or perhaps that just shows up as italic colored text
in the RX buffer which is replaced by the actual text when it appears).

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1) In receive mode, type a line of text followed by ^r
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2) Press Ctrl-T. The text up to and including the ^r is transmitted and

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Remember that fldigi will pause transmission whenever it encounters the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> text cursor, so that must always be positioned past the text you want to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> send (and the ^r)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It is easy to prefix every line with some text.  You would put that text
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in a macro and press the correct F-key at the beginning of each chunk of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> text you are sending.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Seek and ye shall find,
</I>&gt;<i> Ask and it shall be given,
</I>&gt;<i> Knock and the door shall be opened unto you.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks Stelios, I've used that technique so many times I forgot that it
</I>&gt;<i> was there!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Instead of the ^t you could also the default F9 macro to start the
</I>&gt;<i> transmit.  And oh yes,  that is not a control-r that you enter in to the
</I>&gt;<i> text.  It is the carat followed by the r.  The transmit is control-t as
</I>&gt;<i> Stelios points out.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A variation on the above is to create multiple macro lines where each
</I>&gt;<i> has a line of text followed by the ^r, as in:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;this is a line of text
</I>&gt;<i> ^r&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note the newline between text and ^r ... makes it easier to read.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then simply press the macro key(s) for those lines and send each with a
</I>&gt;<i> new control-t.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another variation would be to create a single macro with all of the text
</I>&gt;<i> lines that need to be sent one at a time
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> this is line 1^r
</I>&gt;<i> this is line 2^r
</I>&gt;<i> this is line 3^r
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> this is line N^r
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The transmit process is again the same.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For interactive line by line you will need to use the technique that
</I>&gt;<i> Stelios outlined.
