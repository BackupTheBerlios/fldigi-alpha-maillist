<PRE>When fldigi (and other apps) would crash, the previous
version 10.5 (Leopard) of the Mac OS X would present
you with a Yes/No button to send the Crash Report to
Apple.  If the crash involved an Apple app, I would
sometimes send it to Apple but I would never sent Crash
Reports on 3rd party apps to Apple. If the report was
something I felt may be of interest, I would copy the
report and send it to the developer.

With the new version 10.6 (Snow Leopard) of OS X,
Apple has pulled the user options.  Too bad  this reflector
strips attachments. The new Snow Leopard gives the
user three options: Reopen (to try the app again), OK
(to send the Crash Report to Apple) and Show Details
(to display the Crash Report.  I have not found an option
to do nothing. 

I have a habit of turning off my rig before closing
fldig and this action causes fldigi to generate a nag
note in the Event Log to let me know I screwed up.
The Snow Leopard then triggers a Crash Report to be
sent to Apple. 

For example, the dialog box says
------
    Flgigi quit unexpectedly.

    Click Reopen to open the application again. This report
    will be sent to Apple automatically.
-------

I hate to think how many fldig Crash Reports went
to Apple while I was trying to get RigCAT to work with
my Kenwood TS-570.  I finally gave up and reverted
to Hamlib that works.

As an Alpha tester, we tend to push things a little
harder than normal users and like the old bumper
sticker says - It Happens. I am still trying to find
a way to avoid sending all Crash Reports to Apple.
