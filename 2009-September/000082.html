Sure. That's fine but they are not mutually-exclusive requirements.
Once you have automatic configuration you can always manually
configure to limit the number of modes you want to report. Heck, right
now I am only interested in two modes, Olivia and Thor, so I know what
you mean. And I would like to do that over a very wide swath of
spectrum.

There was a time when amateur radio depended on the skill of
operators. Heck, there was a time when computer networking depended on
the skill of the operators. Those of us working on building networks
discovered that, with just a little effort, we could automate the
configuration process thus bringing huge advances in reliability and
usability.

Much of amateur radio seems mired in the need to demonstrate arcane
skill. Unfortunately it is what has made amateur radio become mostly
irrelevant. Think back on the history of amateur radio. Up until the
1960's amateur radio was still at the forefront of RF communications
development. Since then, not so much. By the end of the 1980's nothing
new was coming out of amateur radio except where a few people were
doing research on their own and moving that to the commercial sector.
(Parts of the Internet are examples of this.)

However, there is a place where amateur radio has the potential to
lead the industry. HF communications has been largely ignored by
industry as a result of high-bandwidth terrestrial and satellite
links. These depend on infrastructure. There are some real advantages
to communications systems that are completely independent of
established infrastructure. Highly-reliable, self-configuring digital
HF links seem to fill that bill. The trick now is to eliminate the
arcane skill required to make it work. We actually have a pretty good
example of something that works surprisingly well -- PACTOR. If you
have used the WinLink or SailMail systems you know what I mean. But
there is a LOT of room for improvement in PACTOR and the layers above
it. Fldigi represents a springboard for developing something newer,
better, and more automatic.

Just thinking aloud.
