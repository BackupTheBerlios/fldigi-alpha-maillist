</I>Actually the reason for the difference in the behavior between 3.12.4 
and 3.13xx is quite simple.  It just happened to be the last tab I had 
opened when I was fiddling with the gui design.  That is the default the 
very first time you open that set of tabs for any execution of fldigi.  
Subsequent visits to the rig control tabs will open the last tab you 
were at.  That memory disappears when you close fldigi.  In order to 
alter that behavior it would be necessary to save the state of every tab 
and sub tab in the configuration dialog.  Whew!  We are already saving a 
ton of configuration items and program states.
