</I>&gt;<i> beyond the bandwidth allowed by FCC Rules and Regs.
</I>
I have been frustrated by interference from automated PACTOR
operations as well. They seem to want to light-up in the middle of my
Olivia QSOs. :-) This just points out where there needs to be
improvement.

As for exceeding the alloted bandwidth, well, that is a legal/policy
issue, not a technical one. Certainly PACTOR 1 and PACTOR 2 definitely
fall within bandwidth limitations. For that matter it does a good job
of showing up our antiquated system for determining acceptable
bandwidth limits. PACTOR could actually be considered more efficient
because it uses and relinquishes the bandwidth quickly, thus making
that spectrum reusable.

&gt;<i> So some operator interaction is required in Amateur Operations even in
</I>&gt;<i> EmComm and perhaps more so in EmComm
</I>&gt;<i> than on a day to day basis.&#160; If one is properly using Winlink in the Amateur
</I>&gt;<i> bands it should be controlled by an operator and not
</I>&gt;<i> automated to reduce harmful interference.
</I>
And therefore there is room for improvement. One part of improving the
protocol is having it recognize intelligence already in the channel
even if it is a different modulation/CODEC.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;But
</I>&gt;<i> there is a LOT of room for improvement in PACTOR and the layers above
</I>&gt;<i> it.
</I>&gt;<i> There is room for improvement in&#160; a lot of areas for certain.&#160; Developing
</I>&gt;<i> modes that do not involve and exclusive patented interface
</I>&gt;<i> allows for more experimentation and further development.&#160; PACTOR&#160; is seeing
</I>&gt;<i> this limitation presently I feel.
</I>
I agree completely. The closed nature of PACTOR means it is a dead
end. But we can still learn from it and use that knowledge as a
springboard to something better.

&gt;&gt;<i> Fldigi represents a springboard for developing something newer,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> better, and more automatic.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Embracing your points (and I do see some merits if one desires to operate as
</I>&gt;<i> you describe) any configuration set-up should have some manual override or
</I>&gt;<i> selectivity to add or subtract features.&#160; If one chooses the automatic
</I>&gt;<i> configuration then that can function in and of itself.&#160; Should one not want
</I>&gt;<i> that then we should be able to select a manual configuration and set things
</I>&gt;<i> according to our individual requirements and or style of operation.
</I>
Agreed. In some cases the human may make a better decision than the automation.

&gt;<i> As you are interested in EmComm
</I>
Actually, I am not particularly interested in EmComm (although I can
see where this would be useful to EmComm). My interest stems from a
selfish desire to have reliable, low-bit-rate communications via HF
from my boat at sea and from purely intellectual curiosity. Just
having something that is automated and reliable is certainly
interesting in and of itself.

&gt;<i> you may want to be familiar or even qualify
</I>&gt;<i> as a certified COML (Communications Unit Leader)
</I>&gt;<i> which will give you a broader understanding of Agency needs and Comm.
</I>
That presumes that the Agencies actually understand their own needs,
something that I am not sure we can take for granted.

&gt;<i> Requirements and Obligations in Disaster or All Hazards
</I>&gt;<i> events.&#160; It may help you better define how Amateur Radio can augment
</I>&gt;<i> agencies in your community.
</I>
That is certainly a possibility.

&gt;<i> Here is a link that may be of interest to you.
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.safecomprogram.gov/SAFECOM/currentprojects/comltraining/">http://www.safecomprogram.gov/SAFECOM/currentprojects/comltraining/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If we want to facilitate automatic operations to include how Winlink and
</I>&gt;<i> perhaps future programs may want to operate on the bands then we should work
</I>&gt;<i> with ARRL to develop Band Plans that facilitate these approaches and if
</I>&gt;<i> necessary Petition for rule changes to ensure legality which may further the
</I>&gt;<i> state of the art in the public interest and for the public good.
</I>
You have jumped well ahead of the scope in which I am thinking. My
thoughts are geared toward research and experimentation, not
implementation. I am certainly not recommending the use of WinLink at
this point, only in using it as an example of what has been tried and
what we can learn from.

&gt;<i> It is interesting to see the different viewpoints on these things.&#160; It is
</I>&gt;<i> indeed a multi faceted Diamond we have.
</I>
I certainly agree there.
