<PRE>*I know that you are sitting in front of your computer and you've all 
been working too hard on testing fldigi.  So here is a little diversion.

This is hysterical.*

* You have to try this.  It is absolutely true.   I guess there are some 
things that the brain cannot handle. *
*
** This will ** confuse your mind and you will keep trying over and over 
again to see if you can outsmart your foot, but, you can't.  It is 
pre-programmed in your brain!

1. While sitting at your desk in front of your computer, lift Your right 
foot off the floor and make clockwise circles.
2. Now, while doing this, draw the number '6' in the air with your right 
hand. Your foot will change direction.

I told you so! And there's nothing you can do about it!   You and I both 
know how stupid it is, but before the  day is done you are going to try 
it again, if you've not already done so.

Send it to your friends to frustrate them too  
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!*

Dave
