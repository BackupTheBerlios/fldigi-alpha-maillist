Hi Ed,

I wonder if you spend most of your time looking at PSK31 rather than 
some of the other digi modes. I expect that there are very few if any 
hams using RSID with the PSK modes because the overwhelming majority is 
PSK31 and everyone recognizes it from the waterfall. PSK64 is easily 
spotted from the width of the waterfall. It could help with QPSK vs PSK, 
but I can't remember the last time I saw a QPSK signal.

I listen a lot for the other digi modes and many of them sound alike, at 
least until you've learned to recognize the subtleties. All the multiFSK 
signals sound alike and many of them have the same width and appearance 
on the waterfall (at least to me). RSID allows you to copy the signal 
right away without having to try all the combinations. And there is a 
fair amount of RSID on those signals. I hear/see it all the time.

I like the two added buttons and don't find the gui too crowded, but 
that's just my opinion. Fwiw, I am personally not involved with the 
emcomm modes.

And btw, I appreciate all the help you've provided to me and everyone 
else on this list.

Bob W6CP
