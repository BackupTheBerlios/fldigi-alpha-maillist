This is where RSID shines. Prior to RSID, users had to refer to the
Sights &amp; Sounds on the web site. But the only down side, is the signal
you are trying to decode using RSID.

</I>

Instead of buttons, could this not be done via macro tags ? But then
how would the user know the state of the transmit RSID. So I guess we
are back to being somewhere on the gui. 


 
&gt;<i> And btw, I appreciate all the help you've provided to me and everyone 
</I>&gt;<i> else on this list.

Thanks

Well anyway these were just my thoughts and I guess to have complete
user control of RSID and the pskreporter these buttons need to be
somewhere.
