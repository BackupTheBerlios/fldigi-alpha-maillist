<PRE>Dave, Rein and team,

After a fair amount of testing with 3.13AE and a new version of the PSKMail
server to be released are a few comments and requests:

1. RSID enables some pretty powerful modes to be used effectively. In the
past using MFSK16 was notably difficult since tuning is so critical. The
first part of the frame was often cut since the squelch would only rise as
the AFC corrected the mis-tuning.

Now with RSID it locks in strait away and decodes from the beginning with
only a minimum lag.

2. When using RSID for a transmission, there seems to be little value in
sending the post frame RSID since, if the pre-frame one didn't work, we
missed the fame anyway. So I would propose either to remove the post-frame
one when in &quot;Server&quot; mode or make it optional.

3. It seems that the initialisation from the PSKMail server disables RSID
automatically (since it is always started after Fldigi), but the indicator
on the main screen stays on. I have to disable and re-enable for RSID to
work it seems.

4. We need to have RSID enabled automatically for auto restart of PSKMail.
Two options in my opinion: Since RSID is now background there is no harm in
leaving it in the last status it was and not disabling it automatically at
Fldigi startup. Or we have a command in the arq_io section to enable RSID.
We would then have an option within the PSKMail server to set RSID on or not
at start up.

5. I noticed that while modes like PSK and MFSK get a full green squelch bar
on reception, the Thor modes only produce a 1/2 bar at best (even at +20dB
S/N ratio). This is an issue since when we switch modes, the low point of
the squelch level need to be adjusted to avoid picking up QRM while still
responding fast enough to avoid cutting the start of the frame. So if the
THOR modes could produce a full bar as well that would be useful.

6. Back on the Fldigi lockup when overlapping TX: we corrected the
overlapping transmissions from the server side, but I am still concerned
that random issues would produce a locked modem. (I had one instance during
last night testings where I could not trace the lockup to a known condition,
but it behaved like a TX overlap lockup).

So in my opinion, Fldigi should either, as discussed earlier, queue the
request OR in fact simply ignore it since it is an abnormal situation. It is
much better to miss a Tx frame (that's why we have the R in ARQ) than having
a locked application that disables the whole system.

Your comments are much appreciated.

Thanks and regards,

John
