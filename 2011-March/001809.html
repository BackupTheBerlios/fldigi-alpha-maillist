<PRE>I'm getting to be a chronic complainer, I guess.  Every time there is a 
new version and I install it on my Fedora 14 Linux system I have trouble
getting it to run - for a while - and then it starts working.

Whether it's the pre-compiled version or compiled from source doesn't
seem to make any difference.  I try to start it from an icon in the
top bar and nothing happens, meaning it crashed.  I try to start it
from a terminal window and a whole bunch of information appears in the
screen as it crashes.  About the time I try to capture all that 
information it quits doing it.

What is a constant, when starting it by hand, is that it reports the COM
ports and then says it can't connect to the jack audio server.  I don't
know what the jack audio server is, or why it is trying to connect to it,
or why I want to have one.

Sometimes I try setting aside the .fldigi directory and let it create
a new one.

Now here is a clue from the last round of that.  I started configuring,
and as soon as I choose memory mapping as the method of rig control and
click on initialize it crashes.  So if I try again and choose some other
method of rig control and initialize it is OK, and then I can change to
memory mapping and it is still OK.  So there may be something going wrong
if it's trying to initialize the rig control when memory mapping is
selected for the first time.

I'm not having any of this trouble in the Windows version.

Am I the only one using a Kachina and memory mapping?  It sure works
well when it works.
