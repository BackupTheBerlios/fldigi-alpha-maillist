<PRE>At the start of each month I save the previous month&#185;s
log in a .fldig/logs-archive folder and start over with a
fresh newlog.adif file.

There were no calls in the newlog.adif I created and
that caused fldgit to created an entry in the Event log.
I had just worked PJ5/AH6HF on SSB so I tried to
enter the new QSO in the newly created newlog.adif
file and ran into two issues.

I opened the newlog.adif using the fldigi/View Logbook
menu and typed in the new QSO in the blanks and
clicked on the &#179;Update&#178; button to save the new entry.
To be sure it was saved, I even used the File/Logs/Save
logbook button. I then Saved the configuration and quit ....
assuming I was good to go for another month.

Wrong assumption on my part because the next time
I opened fldigi, it nagged me that I had an empty log.
I opened the saved newlog.adif file and the QSO I had
entered was not there.

My conclusion was fldigi will not allow you to type in
a new entry to the log.  The only new QSO entry device
in fldigi is the via the main fldigi panel. Seems strange
you can edit a log entry but cannot add a new one to
the log.

I then type in the PJ5/AH6HF call into the fldigi panel
and this time it worked; however, there was no SSB
option under the fldigi mode selector on the left side. I
then opened and corrected the mode by changing it
from USB (useless term) to SSB that is recognized by
both LoTW and DXCC.

Since neither USB or LSB are recognized modes in
the ADIF Specifications,

&lt;<A HREF="http://www.adif.org/adif223.htm#Mode%20Enumeration">http://www.adif.org/adif223.htm#Mode%20Enumeration</A>&gt;

I was going to recommend they both be dropped and
replaced with SSB; however, this would present a new
issue with rig control because radio manufactures have
limited mode reporting and do not recognize SSB or
Phone. Catch-22.  

For this reason I recommend that SSB be added to
the fldigi mode selector in the next normal fldigi
maintenance release.

There are no LoTW or DXCC Awards for USB or LSB.
These are radio modes that have nothing to do with
how we should log QSOs.

Thanks for reading

Ps: Even though not covered in the ADIF specification it
is my understanding the ARRL DXCC Desk may accept
USB, LSB or SSB as credit for Phone awards on QSL
cards.  LoTW uses the ADIF Specifications.  This is
another Time ON vs. Time OFF thing.
