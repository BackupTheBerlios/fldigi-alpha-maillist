<PRE>I made a few QSO&#185;s using fldgi-3.13AN in the Makrothen
RTTY contest where the exchange is the grid square. Fldigi
did fine but I noticed one item and I am not sure if this is
normal or an RFI issue with my setup.

Reference: Capturing QSO data
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.w1hkj.com/FldigiHelp/Logbook.html">http://www.w1hkj.com/FldigiHelp/Logbook.html</A>&gt;

One of the fldigi Contest Long Menu items is the ability
right-click on the received report (in this case the grid
square) and select Exchange in and fldigi will log the
exchange.

The item I noticed was this option would not work while
I was transmitting.  I don't know if that is a limitation
of fldigi or if it was due to RFI?

I was mostly using Search and Pounce mode and I
would sent my call Macro (hiscall DE mycall mycall K)
and he would ACK my call and send his grid twice. I
then would use my Report macro (hiscall EM10 EM10 mycall
TU) and while I was transmitting I would try to select
and log his report using the right-click/Exchnage in
option.  This was when I observed I could not use the
capture data option when I was transmitting.  I had
to wait until my Report macro finished sending before
I could select and log his report. I gave up trying to
use the capture data option and just typed in the
data - it was much faster.

Is the fldigi capture QSO data option blanked (or
locked out) while fldigi is sending data?
