<PRE>Hi Joe, try this:

Select macro set 4 in fldigi.

Create a macro for F9 that is labeled &quot;Myself&quot; and make the macro &lt;K0OG&gt;.
Create another macro for F12 that is labeled &quot;Send&quot; and make the macro 
&lt;TX&gt;&lt;RX&gt;

To &quot;chat&quot; in fldigi without flarq or Plain Talk:

1. Press F9
2. Type what you want to say, for example, Not all hams are radio amateurs!
3. Press F12 to transmit what you want to say with &lt;K0OG&gt; appended to 
the start of the text and automatically return to receive.

The advantage in using a macro to &quot;Send&quot; instead of pressing Enter, as 
in a chat application, is that you can add CRLF's such as:
This is line one
This is line two
This is line three

and fldigi will transmit it that way.

Is that what you want to accomplish?
