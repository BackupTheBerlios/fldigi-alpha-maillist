<PRE>1.            I am running Windows 7, and I cannot get a pull down box to
appear to set up Hamlib in the rig configuration. This does not effect me,
as I can and do use RigCAT to control my radio. I have tried renaming the
entire fldigi directory in my user root, which give me a new clean
configuration, but I still cannot get the pull down list to appear. 

 

     Any suggestions? 

 

    (By the way, I have had absolutely no other problems with any on the
fldigi alpha releases with Windows 7, in all of its incarnations as betas,
RC candidates and the final released version - installed last Friday. I also
use two different sound cards, one for the radio and one for the desktop.
Again, no problem.)

 

2.            Did we at one point in time have a macro command to turn on
and off or toggle the TXID? If so, I can not locate it now. 

 

If we did not have it then it might be useful to have, so that on a CQ call
the RSID could be toggled on. Then the first exchange macro could turn it
off, so it is not enabled for every transmission when in a QSO. Then the
last SK macro could then toggle the TXID back on so that others can see the
mode in use. 

 

I am thinking  more use of RSID on modes other than PSK31 is necessary, I
still can not differentiate many of the different digital modes in use, and
anything that helps but does not need us to send unnecessary data, and use
the extra bandwidth of the RSID signals all of the time, has its place and
value.
