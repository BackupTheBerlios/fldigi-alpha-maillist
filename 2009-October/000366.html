<PRE>Hi Skip,

I'll jump in here to answer.  I believe Joe works during the day.

On the day of testing Joe's message refers to, we were practicing running a 
fldigi/flarq style network for EOC to EOC operation.  The PA guys have done 
a great job with the fldigi/wrap operation so we thought we'd try something 
a little different.

We were using macros for burst transmission in fldigi.  That works just fine 
for us testers when using fldigi with higher speed modes.  Where the 
confusion may be coming from is that we are thinking in terms of having to 
teach non-digitally experienced hams to use NBEMS during an emergency 
situation.  We look for ways to use those people effectively for passing 
tactical traffic on short notice.  For that, simpler is better as long as it 
is still effective.

We accidentally discovered how convenient it was to have full time Plain 
Talk operation while running a net with multiple stations.  We had been 
using the burst transmission macro method on fldigi to coordinate operation. 
When it came time to send a message using flarq, two stations connected with 
flarq and coordinated with each other using Plain Talk.  The rest of us 
could keep track of what they were doing by watching the raw transmissions 
in the fldigi window.  Gradually we found we tended to make all our text 
comments via the Plain Talk transmit line since hitting enter sends the line 
even without a connection.  It worked for us but sometimes it was a little 
confusing depending upon how flarq segmented the text line for transmission.

Just for the heck of it, two more of us also connected to each other.  That 
meant there were two fairly idle connections operating simultaneously.  That 
is probably not something we would want to do on a regular basis but we were 
testing after all.  We noticed then the Plain Talk messaging scheme does not 
care what connections the messages are coming from.  All plain talk text 
showed up on all connected flarqs.  That was really handy since now we 
didn't have the problem of mentally reassembling the segmented text on 
fldigi window.  Of course, then we discovered that we did not no for sure 
who transmitted what.  We began manually inserting our callsigns in each 
text line.

Once we had a chance to think about what we were doing, we all came to the 
conclusion that we could make even better use of flarq if it had the option 
to display unconnected Plain Talk lines and use the callsigns already 
available in the message header show them in the text.  Our thinking was 
that once we had a transceiver set up and operating with fldigi and flarq, 
we could fairly easily teach someone to chat back and forth with Plain Talk 
and connect and disconnect when traffic is passed.  Keep in mind that the 
radio side of thing is only part of the teaching problem.  We also have to 
deal with the different file directories and file types involved, plus how 
traffic is handed off to and received from the rest of the EOC staff.

Anyway, this is a long story but sometimes I think it is necessary to give a 
little of the background to know why a subject comes up.  This thing about 
the unconnected Plain Talk operation and callsigns in NOT a make or break 
thing.  It is just one of those ideas that comes up during testing.  While 
there are several of us here in Missouri that like the idea, I bet there are 
others groups that may not care for it.

Now for the rest of the testing.  FLDIGI and FLARQ rock!  We had an 
especially good day for testing.  We were on 3585 during the mid morning 
hours and then later in the afternoon.  Our NVIS path distances varied from 
30 miles to over 150 miles which we felt was a good sample for Missouri 
regional operation.  What made this day so good was that thunder storms were 
moving over and between our stations, providing plenty of strong QRN plus we 
experienced some deep QSB in the afternoon.  Conditions were bad enough that 
MFSK32 was very poor.  Our best operation, believe it or not, was with 
BPSK250.   During our checks using fldigi and keyboard operation to find a 
good mode, we pretty much had to give up until we went to BPSK250.  Keyboard 
to keyboard was much better and were able to pass messages with flarq very 
well.  I think we were all operating with our jaws on the table top. 
BPSK250 was not supposed to work under these conditions.  The Gettysburg 
Address went through during very heavy QRN and QSB in 91 seconds.  I think 
that says a lot for the fldigi and flarq software and BPSK250.

We did notice a quirk with DominoEX though.  Keyboard to keyboard operation 
was about the same as with MFSK but when we tried to use it with flarq, we 
noticed that none of the ARQ special characters (&lt;soh&gt;, &lt;eot&gt;, etc.) were 
displayed in fldigi during receive.  Of course, flarq connects did not work.

Anyway, that's my story and I'm sticking to it.

&gt;<i> Hi Joe, try this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Select macro set 4 in fldigi.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Create a macro for F9 that is labeled &quot;Myself&quot; and make the macro &lt;K0OG&gt;.
</I>&gt;<i> Create another macro for F12 that is labeled &quot;Send&quot; and make the macro
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;TX&gt;&lt;RX&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To &quot;chat&quot; in fldigi without flarq or Plain Talk:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Press F9
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Type what you want to say, for example, Not all hams are radio 
</I>&gt;<i> amateurs!
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Press F12 to transmit what you want to say with &lt;K0OG&gt; appended to
</I>&gt;<i> the start of the text and automatically return to receive.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The advantage in using a macro to &quot;Send&quot; instead of pressing Enter, as
</I>&gt;<i> in a chat application, is that you can add CRLF's such as:
</I>&gt;<i> This is line one
</I>&gt;<i> This is line two
</I>&gt;<i> This is line three
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> and fldigi will transmit it that way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is that what you want to accomplish?
