<PRE>Dave,

Maybe not designed for the way we were trying to use it, but we're 
presenting a new idea, and it just came kind of naturally to all four of 
us who were experimenting this PM.  If we had one station who could 
&quot;anchor&quot; and accept multiple connects, along with the other mod we 
suggested for the &lt;callsign&gt; header in the PT window, it would make for 
an interesting roundtable/chat system with minimal formal NCS 
intervention.  This is not so much for EMCOMM use, but I suppose could 
be in some scenarios.  If you and the team don't want to pursue this, I 
would be sorry, but will live by your constraints.  I'm convinced that 
there would be some demand/use of this kind of functionality since it 
came so naturally (and unexpectedly) to all of us today.

Concerning the mail files, I'm using the latest version AX.  I manually 
searched through the C:\Documents and Settings\&lt;my user ID&gt;\NBEMS.files 
directory tree, and found no e-mail files. I searched my whole hard 
drive for .eml files, and none came up (except ones I sent, which are in 
the &quot;out&quot; folder).  They went &quot;somewhere else...&quot;  Ha!

73,
-Joe-

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to paste it prior to each line I would type.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in Flarq to open the received e-mail and received-files directories.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;<i> Which version of flarq?  The one with the alpha fldigi?  If so then 
</I>&gt;<i> the folder structure is fixed for both flarq and fldigi.  See on of my
