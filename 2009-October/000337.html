<PRE>Skip,

I understand what you are saying, but we are envisioning a NCS or
&quot;anchor&quot; station to whom everyone would connect, then chat and send
messages back-and-forth.  However, we even found that if there were
daisy-chained connections (rather than a star-network topography with an
anchor station), all could use the PT window nicely (except for the
absence of the &lt;callsign&gt; headers).  This is because of the lack of
ability of the PT window to display messages when not connected to
another station.  That is why it would be nice to at least have a config
item which would &quot;Allow display of PT messages even when unconnected.&quot;

With slight modification, it would work nicely in a roundtable
situation.  Even with our calsign-paste technique, it worked nicely as
long as everyone was connected to someone.

This fine software yields perhaps unintended consequences!  Ha, ha!

73,
