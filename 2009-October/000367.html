<PRE>    Gary, great posting!

    I've been so busy lately...took a vacation with the XYL, I'm in the 
middle of football season, had to step in as acting EC, and we've got our 
SET this Saturday.  When I get a spare minute, I very much want to revisit 
flarq.  There seems to be an increase in interest in it, particularly with 
PSK250.

73,
Harry Bloomberg W3YJ

</I>&gt;<i> I'll jump in here to answer.  I believe Joe works during the day.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On the day of testing Joe's message refers to, we were practicing running a
</I>&gt;<i> fldigi/flarq style network for EOC to EOC operation.  The PA guys have done
</I>&gt;<i> a great job with the fldigi/wrap operation so we thought we'd try something
</I>&gt;<i> a little different.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We were using macros for burst transmission in fldigi.  That works just fine
</I>&gt;<i> for us testers when using fldigi with higher speed modes.  Where the
</I>&gt;<i> confusion may be coming from is that we are thinking in terms of having to
</I>&gt;<i> teach non-digitally experienced hams to use NBEMS during an emergency
</I>&gt;<i> situation.  We look for ways to use those people effectively for passing
</I>&gt;<i> tactical traffic on short notice.  For that, simpler is better as long as it
</I>&gt;<i> is still effective.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We accidentally discovered how convenient it was to have full time Plain
</I>&gt;<i> Talk operation while running a net with multiple stations.  We had been
</I>&gt;<i> using the burst transmission macro method on fldigi to coordinate operation.
</I>&gt;<i> When it came time to send a message using flarq, two stations connected with
</I>&gt;<i> flarq and coordinated with each other using Plain Talk.  The rest of us
</I>&gt;<i> could keep track of what they were doing by watching the raw transmissions
</I>&gt;<i> in the fldigi window.  Gradually we found we tended to make all our text
</I>&gt;<i> comments via the Plain Talk transmit line since hitting enter sends the line
</I>&gt;<i> even without a connection.  It worked for us but sometimes it was a little
</I>&gt;<i> confusing depending upon how flarq segmented the text line for transmission.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Just for the heck of it, two more of us also connected to each other.  That
</I>&gt;<i> meant there were two fairly idle connections operating simultaneously.  That
</I>&gt;<i> is probably not something we would want to do on a regular basis but we were
</I>&gt;<i> testing after all.  We noticed then the Plain Talk messaging scheme does not
</I>&gt;<i> care what connections the messages are coming from.  All plain talk text
</I>&gt;<i> showed up on all connected flarqs.  That was really handy since now we
</I>&gt;<i> didn't have the problem of mentally reassembling the segmented text on
</I>&gt;<i> fldigi window.  Of course, then we discovered that we did not no for sure
</I>&gt;<i> who transmitted what.  We began manually inserting our callsigns in each
</I>&gt;<i> text line.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Once we had a chance to think about what we were doing, we all came to the
</I>&gt;<i> conclusion that we could make even better use of flarq if it had the option
</I>&gt;<i> to display unconnected Plain Talk lines and use the callsigns already
</I>&gt;<i> available in the message header show them in the text.  Our thinking was
</I>&gt;<i> that once we had a transceiver set up and operating with fldigi and flarq,
</I>&gt;<i> we could fairly easily teach someone to chat back and forth with Plain Talk
</I>&gt;<i> and connect and disconnect when traffic is passed.  Keep in mind that the
</I>&gt;<i> radio side of thing is only part of the teaching problem.  We also have to
</I>&gt;<i> deal with the different file directories and file types involved, plus how
</I>&gt;<i> traffic is handed off to and received from the rest of the EOC staff.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, this is a long story but sometimes I think it is necessary to give a
</I>&gt;<i> little of the background to know why a subject comes up.  This thing about
</I>&gt;<i> the unconnected Plain Talk operation and callsigns in NOT a make or break
</I>&gt;<i> thing.  It is just one of those ideas that comes up during testing.  While
</I>&gt;<i> there are several of us here in Missouri that like the idea, I bet there are
</I>&gt;<i> others groups that may not care for it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now for the rest of the testing.  FLDIGI and FLARQ rock!  We had an
</I>&gt;<i> especially good day for testing.  We were on 3585 during the mid morning
</I>&gt;<i> hours and then later in the afternoon.  Our NVIS path distances varied from
</I>&gt;<i> 30 miles to over 150 miles which we felt was a good sample for Missouri
</I>&gt;<i> regional operation.  What made this day so good was that thunder storms were
</I>&gt;<i> moving over and between our stations, providing plenty of strong QRN plus we
</I>&gt;<i> experienced some deep QSB in the afternoon.  Conditions were bad enough that
</I>&gt;<i> MFSK32 was very poor.  Our best operation, believe it or not, was with
</I>&gt;<i> BPSK250.   During our checks using fldigi and keyboard operation to find a
</I>&gt;<i> good mode, we pretty much had to give up until we went to BPSK250.  Keyboard
</I>&gt;<i> to keyboard was much better and were able to pass messages with flarq very
</I>&gt;<i> well.  I think we were all operating with our jaws on the table top.
</I>&gt;<i> BPSK250 was not supposed to work under these conditions.  The Gettysburg
</I>&gt;<i> Address went through during very heavy QRN and QSB in 91 seconds.  I think
</I>&gt;<i> that says a lot for the fldigi and flarq software and BPSK250.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We did notice a quirk with DominoEX though.  Keyboard to keyboard operation
</I>&gt;<i> was about the same as with MFSK but when we tried to use it with flarq, we
</I>&gt;<i> noticed that none of the ARQ special characters (&lt;soh&gt;, &lt;eot&gt;, etc.) were
</I>&gt;<i> displayed in fldigi during receive.  Of course, flarq connects did not work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, that's my story and I'm sticking to it.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi Joe, try this:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Select macro set 4 in fldigi.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Create a macro for F9 that is labeled &quot;Myself&quot; and make the macro &lt;K0OG&gt;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Create another macro for F12 that is labeled &quot;Send&quot; and make the macro
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;TX&gt;&lt;RX&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> To &quot;chat&quot; in fldigi without flarq or Plain Talk:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1. Press F9
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2. Type what you want to say, for example, Not all hams are radio
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> amateurs!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3. Press F12 to transmit what you want to say with &lt;K0OG&gt; appended to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the start of the text and automatically return to receive.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The advantage in using a macro to &quot;Send&quot; instead of pressing Enter, as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in a chat application, is that you can add CRLF's such as:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is line one
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is line two
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is line three
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and fldigi will transmit it that way.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Is that what you want to accomplish?
