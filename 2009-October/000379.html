<PRE>Dick,

I'm running AY on Windows XP Pro SP3, and find that of all the various 
modes and sub-modes, RTTY is the only one which reverts to something 
different than it was when I closed Fldigi (the default 170 Hz, 45.5 
Baud).  If I set it to some different sub-mode, close the program, then 
re-open it, the mode comes back to 170/45.5.  It appears that your 
&quot;default&quot; is different than my &quot;default&quot; - strange!

All of this with my radio not transmitting.  So, I tried it with the 
radio turned off, and get the same result.

So, I tried a custom RTTY config, saved the configuration, and after 
closing and re-opening the program, my custom settings came back up!  
After further experimentation, I found that whatever settings are set 
for the RTTY sub-mode when you save your Fldigi configuration, that is 
what will default whenever you open Fldigi in RTTY mode.  Bug?  
Feature?  You decide!   ;-) 

73,
-Joe-

Designed that way.

What mode you were on is saved in the status file.  How that mode was configure is saved in the configuration file.  You need to look under the covers at the code to fully understand what is a mode and what is a configuration.

PSK31, PSK63, QPSK125 etc are all modes.
THOR4, THOR16 ... are all modes.

RTTY is a mode
all of its 2 raised to 8th power variants are configurations.  So,  decide what you favorite RTTY configuration should be and then save it.

Dave
