<PRE>An alternative which I have found very versitile and efficient is
puppy linux ..
which can boot from cd .. or be installed
to hd (fat32, or ext2/3 partition) .. I have had both working ...
there is a development package (.sfs in puppy .. devx??.sfs where ??
is the version number of puppy) which allows you to compile the src
...
you will need to download fltk (etc as described in the documentation
on compiling fldigi) but after a bit of fiddling I can now compile and
run the very latest src releases of fldigi ...
I have all the options with the exception of pulseaudio working also
(in particular hamlib works fine and I use this for keying via the
serial interface on my k2)

cheers

</I>&gt;<i> is aware of properly handling *nix and other partitions and does not have the
</I>&gt;<i> problem of cylinder boundaries that PM does. I own that one, but mostly just
</I>&gt;<i> use the Mandriva utility to do the partitioning these days.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you just use the utility to shrink the existing Windows NTFS partition,
</I>&gt;<i> leaving the amount of hard drive space that you want free and unpartitioned,
</I>&gt;<i> let the Linux installer decide the rest, and then install GRUB automatically

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I do things more complex here because I have many Linux and Microsoft versions
</I>&gt;<i> on the same machine. I won't go into that now. It's not hard but takes just a
</I>&gt;<i> little more planning and a different bootloader in the MBR chaining to the
</I>&gt;<i> individual bootloaders in the various partition's boot partition root sector.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've had W98, 2K, XP, W7, Solaris 8 and 9, and quite a few Linux distros all

</I>&gt;<i> the applications. Hard drives are cheap enough now not trying to get multiple
</I>&gt;<i> revisions of apps that have changing configs working is just not worth the
</I>&gt;<i> grief. I keep them separate and never have an issue. I do share the swap
</I>&gt;<i> partition under Linux.
