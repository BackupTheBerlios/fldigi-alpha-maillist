You are perhaps right about my comments on the specifics of PSKmail
but not about my comments on propagation in general. I have a great
deal of clue about the effects of HF propagation on various modulation
schemes.

&gt;<i> We have 5 years experience with this, and we would not be using PSK250 if it did not work...
</I>&gt;<i> When it works it is 4x faster than any other mode.
</I>
And there is the operant phrase -- &quot;when it works&quot;. Yes, PSK250 is
going to work under some conditions, e.g. single-hop propagation near
the MUF where multipath is nonexistent. Once you start to get
multipath the doppler phase modulates the signal greatly increasing
bit error rate.

&gt;<i> In those cases where &#160;it does not work we are using THOR22 or MFSK32, depending on band condx.
</I>
That is very sensible because the modes based on MFSK, e.g. Thor,
DominoEX, MFSK16/32, etc, are designed with long integration times.
They are also noncoherent so phase modulation due to doppler is no
factor.

&gt;<i> Actually, we use PSK250, PSK125, THOR22, THOR11, THOR8, MFSK32, MFSK16.
</I>&gt;<i> We can switch modes during a session. By using RSID on the servers (using fldigi-3.13)
</I>&gt;<i> the mode is no issue anymore.... Still PSK250 Is used 90% of the time...
</I>
I understand. Thank you for clarifying. Next time I will do better
homework first. I was not aware that pskmail was adaptive based on
conditions. I must admit, I painted pskmail with a broad brush based
on my general experience that hams will generally come up with a
substandard way of doing things and then cling to that with a tenacity
suggesting religion.
