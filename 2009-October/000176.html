<PRE>Greetings,

I don't know if this is a bug, or a difference of opinion...

I picked up an RSID this afternoon from someone and it identified the 
signal as Hell80.  So, I went to his frequency and the Hell80 mode, and 
found that his two-tone split was 300 Hz.  The two-tone split with 
FLDigi 3.13AH (WinXP Pro) is 480 Hz.  I was able to carry on a crippled 
QSO with the fellow enough to coordinate going to Olivia and asked him 
what software he was running - it was MultiPSK.  After our QSO I opened 
my copy of MultiPSK (which I NEVER use - but keep only for reference) 
and see that it is indeed set up for 300 Hz tone spacing, with no 
mechanism for changing it that I could find.  Also, there is no 
mechanism in FLDigi (that I could find) for changing the tone spacing.  
The only specification I could find was on the FLDigi web page 
indicating a tone spacing of 480 Hz, with a total bandwidth of 800 Hz.  
Interestingly, the MultiPSK page also indicates an 800 Hz bandwidth, but 
does not state what the tone spacing should be.

My conclusion is that MultiPSK is in error, but I can't prove that since 
I did not find any other independent sources for what the Hell80 
standard should be.  Can anyone shed some light on this matter?  Does 
MultiPSK need to be fixed?  Does there need to be a tone-spacing 
parameter in FLDigi to add flexibility to be compatible with MultiPSK?  
Not worth messing with?

73,
-Joe-
