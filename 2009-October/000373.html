<PRE>Re All recent fldigi alphas - Hamlib

Thanks very much to the two kind gentlemen that pointed out how to find and
correct the problem with the hamlib rig configuration.

Which is - Remove all hamlib***.dll files in your path.

I found there were 27 such dll files to remove in one of the windows
sub-directories, so they were in the path, and had been there since the 24th
August. Not sure now which programme loaded them. I had not noticed this
earlier as I normally use flrig or the rigcat configuration.

Dave: If we could have the macro back for TXID it would be useful to at
least one user. - me. but not much lost if this is too much work. I prefer
to use the keyboard more than the mouse as I suffer from carpel tunnel
problems, and you can't toggle the check boxes with the keyboard.

Last comment, the adjustable configuration for the waterfall menu, and the
sizing works very nicely.

Thanks again Dave and Stelios for these excellent programmes.

73, Andy VE3NVK

</I>&gt;<i> 1.            I am running Windows 7, and I cannot get a pull down box to
</I>&gt;<i> appear to set up Hamlib in the rig configuration. This does not effect me,
</I>&gt;<i> as I can and do use RigCAT to control my radio. I have tried renaming the
</I>&gt;<i> entire fldigi directory in my user root, which give me a new clean
</I>&gt;<i> configuration, but I still cannot get the pull down list to appear.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Any suggestions?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    (By the way, I have had absolutely no other problems with any on the
</I>&gt;<i> fldigi alpha releases with Windows 7, in all of its incarnations as betas,
</I>&gt;<i> RC candidates and the final released version - installed last Friday. I
</I>&gt;<i> also
</I>&gt;<i> use two different sound cards, one for the radio and one for the desktop.
</I>&gt;<i> Again, no problem.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2.            Did we at one point in time have a macro command to turn on
</I>&gt;<i> and off or toggle the TXID? If so, I can not locate it now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If we did not have it then it might be useful to have, so that on a CQ call
</I>&gt;<i> the RSID could be toggled on. Then the first exchange macro could turn it
</I>&gt;<i> off, so it is not enabled for every transmission when in a QSO. Then the
</I>&gt;<i> last SK macro could then toggle the TXID back on so that others can see the
</I>&gt;<i> mode in use.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am thinking  more use of RSID on modes other than PSK31 is necessary, I
</I>&gt;<i> still can not differentiate many of the different digital modes in use, and
</I>&gt;<i> anything that helps but does not need us to send unnecessary data, and use
</I>&gt;<i> the extra bandwidth of the RSID signals all of the time, has its place and
</I>&gt;<i> value.

</I>&gt;<i> Hi Skip,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'll jump in here to answer.  I believe Joe works during the day.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On the day of testing Joe's message refers to, we were practicing running a
</I>&gt;<i> fldigi/flarq style network for EOC to EOC operation.  The PA guys have done
</I>&gt;<i> a great job with the fldigi/wrap operation so we thought we'd try something
</I>&gt;<i> a little different.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We were using macros for burst transmission in fldigi.  That works just
</I>&gt;<i> fine
</I>&gt;<i> for us testers when using fldigi with higher speed modes.  Where the
</I>&gt;<i> confusion may be coming from is that we are thinking in terms of having to
</I>&gt;<i> teach non-digitally experienced hams to use NBEMS during an emergency
</I>&gt;<i> situation.  We look for ways to use those people effectively for passing
</I>&gt;<i> tactical traffic on short notice.  For that, simpler is better as long as
</I>&gt;<i> it
</I>&gt;<i> is still effective.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We accidentally discovered how convenient it was to have full time Plain
</I>&gt;<i> Talk operation while running a net with multiple stations.  We had been
</I>&gt;<i> using the burst transmission macro method on fldigi to coordinate
</I>&gt;<i> operation.
</I>&gt;<i> When it came time to send a message using flarq, two stations connected
</I>&gt;<i> with
</I>&gt;<i> flarq and coordinated with each other using Plain Talk.  The rest of us
</I>&gt;<i> could keep track of what they were doing by watching the raw transmissions
</I>&gt;<i> in the fldigi window.  Gradually we found we tended to make all our text
</I>&gt;<i> comments via the Plain Talk transmit line since hitting enter sends the
</I>&gt;<i> line
</I>&gt;<i> even without a connection.  It worked for us but sometimes it was a little
</I>&gt;<i> confusing depending upon how flarq segmented the text line for
</I>&gt;<i> transmission.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Just for the heck of it, two more of us also connected to each other.  That
</I>&gt;<i> meant there were two fairly idle connections operating simultaneously.
</I>&gt;<i>  That
</I>&gt;<i> is probably not something we would want to do on a regular basis but we
</I>&gt;<i> were
</I>&gt;<i> testing after all.  We noticed then the Plain Talk messaging scheme does
</I>&gt;<i> not
</I>&gt;<i> care what connections the messages are coming from.  All plain talk text
</I>&gt;<i> showed up on all connected flarqs.  That was really handy since now we
</I>&gt;<i> didn't have the problem of mentally reassembling the segmented text on
</I>&gt;<i> fldigi window.  Of course, then we discovered that we did not no for sure
</I>&gt;<i> who transmitted what.  We began manually inserting our callsigns in each
</I>&gt;<i> text line.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Once we had a chance to think about what we were doing, we all came to the
</I>&gt;<i> conclusion that we could make even better use of flarq if it had the option
</I>&gt;<i> to display unconnected Plain Talk lines and use the callsigns already
</I>&gt;<i> available in the message header show them in the text.  Our thinking was
</I>&gt;<i> that once we had a transceiver set up and operating with fldigi and flarq,
</I>&gt;<i> we could fairly easily teach someone to chat back and forth with Plain Talk
</I>&gt;<i> and connect and disconnect when traffic is passed.  Keep in mind that the
</I>&gt;<i> radio side of thing is only part of the teaching problem.  We also have to
</I>&gt;<i> deal with the different file directories and file types involved, plus how
</I>&gt;<i> traffic is handed off to and received from the rest of the EOC staff.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, this is a long story but sometimes I think it is necessary to give
</I>&gt;<i> a
</I>&gt;<i> little of the background to know why a subject comes up.  This thing about
</I>&gt;<i> the unconnected Plain Talk operation and callsigns in NOT a make or break
</I>&gt;<i> thing.  It is just one of those ideas that comes up during testing.  While
</I>&gt;<i> there are several of us here in Missouri that like the idea, I bet there
</I>&gt;<i> are
</I>&gt;<i> others groups that may not care for it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now for the rest of the testing.  FLDIGI and FLARQ rock!  We had an
</I>&gt;<i> especially good day for testing.  We were on 3585 during the mid morning
</I>&gt;<i> hours and then later in the afternoon.  Our NVIS path distances varied from
</I>&gt;<i> 30 miles to over 150 miles which we felt was a good sample for Missouri
</I>&gt;<i> regional operation.  What made this day so good was that thunder storms
</I>&gt;<i> were
</I>&gt;<i> moving over and between our stations, providing plenty of strong QRN plus
</I>&gt;<i> we
</I>&gt;<i> experienced some deep QSB in the afternoon.  Conditions were bad enough
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> MFSK32 was very poor.  Our best operation, believe it or not, was with
</I>&gt;<i> BPSK250.   During our checks using fldigi and keyboard operation to find a
</I>&gt;<i> good mode, we pretty much had to give up until we went to BPSK250.
</I>&gt;<i>  Keyboard
</I>&gt;<i> to keyboard was much better and were able to pass messages with flarq very
</I>&gt;<i> well.  I think we were all operating with our jaws on the table top.
</I>&gt;<i> BPSK250 was not supposed to work under these conditions.  The Gettysburg
</I>&gt;<i> Address went through during very heavy QRN and QSB in 91 seconds.  I think
</I>&gt;<i> that says a lot for the fldigi and flarq software and BPSK250.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We did notice a quirk with DominoEX though.  Keyboard to keyboard operation
</I>&gt;<i> was about the same as with MFSK but when we tried to use it with flarq, we
</I>&gt;<i> noticed that none of the ARQ special characters (&lt;soh&gt;, &lt;eot&gt;, etc.) were
</I>&gt;<i> displayed in fldigi during receive.  Of course, flarq connects did not
</I>&gt;<i> work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, that's my story and I'm sticking to it.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi Joe, try this:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Select macro set 4 in fldigi.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Create a macro for F9 that is labeled &quot;Myself&quot; and make the macro &lt;K0OG&gt;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Create another macro for F12 that is labeled &quot;Send&quot; and make the macro
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &lt;TX&gt;&lt;RX&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; To &quot;chat&quot; in fldigi without flarq or Plain Talk:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1. Press F9
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2. Type what you want to say, for example, Not all hams are radio
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; amateurs!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3. Press F12 to transmit what you want to say with &lt;K0OG&gt; appended to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the start of the text and automatically return to receive.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The advantage in using a macro to &quot;Send&quot; instead of pressing Enter, as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in a chat application, is that you can add CRLF's such as:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is line one
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is line two
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is line three
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and fldigi will transmit it that way.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Is that what you want to accomplish?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Once we had a chance to think about what we were doing, we all came to
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; conclusion that we could make even better use of flarq if it had the
</I>&gt;<i> option
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to display unconnected Plain Talk lines and use the callsigns already
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; available in the message header show them in the text.  Our thinking was
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that once we had a transceiver set up and operating with fldigi and
</I>&gt;<i> flarq,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; we could fairly easily teach someone to chat back and forth with Plain
</I>&gt;<i> Talk
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and connect and disconnect when traffic is passed.  Keep in mind that the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; radio side of thing is only part of the teaching problem.  We also have
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; deal with the different file directories and file types involved, plus
</I>&gt;<i> how
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; traffic is handed off to and received from the rest of the EOC staff.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Anyway, this is a long story but sometimes I think it is necessary to
</I>&gt;<i> give a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; little of the background to know why a subject comes up.  This thing
</I>&gt;<i> about
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the unconnected Plain Talk operation and callsigns in NOT a make or break
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; thing.  It is just one of those ideas that comes up during testing.
</I>&gt;<i>  While
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; there are several of us here in Missouri that like the idea, I bet there
</I>&gt;<i> are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; others groups that may not care for it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Now for the rest of the testing.  FLDIGI and FLARQ rock!  We had an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; especially good day for testing.  We were on 3585 during the mid morning
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hours and then later in the afternoon.  Our NVIS path distances varied
</I>&gt;<i> from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 30 miles to over 150 miles which we felt was a good sample for Missouri
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; regional operation.  What made this day so good was that thunder storms
</I>&gt;<i> were
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; moving over and between our stations, providing plenty of strong QRN plus
</I>&gt;<i> we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; experienced some deep QSB in the afternoon.  Conditions were bad enough
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; MFSK32 was very poor.  Our best operation, believe it or not, was with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; BPSK250.   During our checks using fldigi and keyboard operation to find
</I>&gt;<i> a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; good mode, we pretty much had to give up until we went to BPSK250.
</I>&gt;<i>  Keyboard
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to keyboard was much better and were able to pass messages with flarq
</I>&gt;<i> very
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; well.  I think we were all operating with our jaws on the table top.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; BPSK250 was not supposed to work under these conditions.  The Gettysburg
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Address went through during very heavy QRN and QSB in 91 seconds.  I
</I>&gt;<i> think
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that says a lot for the fldigi and flarq software and BPSK250.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We did notice a quirk with DominoEX though.  Keyboard to keyboard
</I>&gt;<i> operation
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; was about the same as with MFSK but when we tried to use it with flarq,
</I>&gt;<i> we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; noticed that none of the ARQ special characters (&lt;soh&gt;, &lt;eot&gt;, etc.) were
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; displayed in fldigi during receive.  Of course, flarq connects did not
</I>&gt;<i> work.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Anyway, that's my story and I'm sticking to it.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Hi Joe, try this:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Select macro set 4 in fldigi.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Create a macro for F9 that is labeled &quot;Myself&quot; and make the macro
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;K0OG&gt;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Create another macro for F12 that is labeled &quot;Send&quot; and make the macro
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &lt;TX&gt;&lt;RX&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; To &quot;chat&quot; in fldigi without flarq or Plain Talk:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 1. Press F9
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 2. Type what you want to say, for example, Not all hams are radio
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; amateurs!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 3. Press F12 to transmit what you want to say with &lt;K0OG&gt; appended to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the start of the text and automatically return to receive.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; The advantage in using a macro to &quot;Send&quot; instead of pressing Enter, as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; in a chat application, is that you can add CRLF's such as:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; This is line one
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; This is line two
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; This is line three
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; and fldigi will transmit it that way.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Is that what you want to accomplish?
