You really don't need to format the new second partition at all after 
shrinking the existing NTFS partition and creating the new one. Just leave it 
unformatted and let the Linux installer format it to whatever file system you 
decide to use. That would be ReiserFS for me here. It will create the 
partition structure for you.

FAT32 is not a journaling file system, so you would not want to use that for 
Linux anyway and I suspect the Linux installer will just reformat that to 
something appropriate anyway.

As to partitioning utilities, Mandriva's installer does a fine job at 
repartitioning existing NTFS drives. I don't know about the Ubuntu installer, 
I've never tried it. As for pay partitioning utilities, for mixed Windows and 
Linux stay (make that run away fast) from Partition Magic. It's a solid 
program, but makes the false assumption that *nix partitions must start on a 
hard drive cylinder boundary, which is not a requirement and many don't. If 
you ever use anything else to work with partitions, or use PM on an already 
partitioned partition set up with a *nix partitioning utility or one that is 
properly aware, you'll have a blown hard drive. Paragon's Hard drive Manager 
is aware of properly handling *nix and other partitions and does not have the 
problem of cylinder boundaries that PM does. I own that one, but mostly just 
use the Mandriva utility to do the partitioning these days.

If you just use the utility to shrink the existing Windows NTFS partition, 
leaving the amount of hard drive space that you want free and unpartitioned, 
let the Linux installer decide the rest, and then install GRUB automatically 
into the MBR, and you will have a dual boot working setup.

I do things more complex here because I have many Linux and Microsoft versions 
on the same machine. I won't go into that now. It's not hard but takes just a 
little more planning and a different bootloader in the MBR chaining to the 
individual bootloaders in the various partition's boot partition root sector.

I've had W98, 2K, XP, W7, Solaris 8 and 9, and quite a few Linux distros all 
installed and multi-booting on the same machine. I never share home or other 
directories across the various Linux distros because the configuration 
differences are just not worth the needless grief across various versions of 
the applications. Hard drives are cheap enough now not trying to get multiple 
revisions of apps that have changing configs working is just not worth the 
grief. I keep them separate and never have an issue. I do share the swap 
partition under Linux.
