Gary,

First let me say that this behavior is intended but not to the extent that
you mentioned and that it is controllable by parameters.

I also noted that the PSK modes are far more susceptible to this drift than
other modes like MSK. THOR doesn't move and has AFC automatically disabled
since it can pickup drifts of up to around 100Hz.

The logic is as follow: when Fldigi is used as a modem like with FLARQ for
example, it is required to listen on a specific frequency and within a
limited range of that frequency (say +/- 20Hz as a typical example).

Since the AFC is required (there may be no operator around at time of
connect) to lock in an incoming signal, the center frequency needs to be
adjusted constantly as the modem is trying to lock in on any signal
(including noise). This would result in the centre frequency drifting
overtime far away from the targeted listening point.

Therefore a few mechanisms are used for this purpose. First there is a
&quot;reset to carrier&quot; function that regularly takes the centre frequency back
to the sweet spot when we don't have a signal lock. Two, there are limits as
to how far the centre frequency can &quot;wonder around&quot;. and three there is a
sensitivity level for the centre frequency search.

These mechanisms are triggered as soon as you start an ARQ application like
FLARQ or Pskmail which explains why you see that behaviour when you start
the latter, and it disappears only when you restart Fldigi.

In 3.13AN you have two tabs for the behaviour of the PSK mode frequency
search: one for QSO mode (Called &quot;General&quot;) and one for AQR mode (called
&quot;Mail&quot;). I have attached two screen copies of my setup as a starting point
for your investigation. These values give me a stable system for psk mode
linkups.

Hope this helps,

Regards,

John (VK2ETA)

</I>&gt;<i> The problem the hopping around seemed to cause is that it looked like I was

</I>&gt;<i> figuring out that it was NOT hearing a BPSK250 signal and to start searching
</I>&gt;<i> again.  Once this frequency hopping starts, shutting down jpskmail does not
</I>&gt;<i> stop it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I believe I have seen this problem crop up during my testing with flarq
</I>&gt;<i> with BPSK250 but didn't find a way to repeat it.  Oh yes, once this starts
</I>&gt;<i> with BPSK250, it continues in other speeds of PSK.  The hopping around thing
</I>&gt;<i> does not seem to show up if I switch some other mode like Olivia or MFSK but
</I>&gt;<i> if I switch back to PSK it starts up again.  This continues until I stop and
</I>&gt;<i> restart fldigi.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To repeat, today's repeatable wierdness:  Windows XP - fldigi up and
</I>&gt;<i> running and successfully monitoring BPSK250 transmissions on 10.148 MHz
</I>&gt;<i> (10.146.5 MHz plus 1500 Hz audio center).  Start jpskmail and after first
</I>&gt;<i> automatic transmission, fldigi receive frequency randomly hops around up to
</I>&gt;<i> 200 Hz.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> First off, I guess I should ask if this is an intended design feature.  If
</I>&gt;<i> it is, what it the intent?
