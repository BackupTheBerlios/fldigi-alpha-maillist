<PRE>Mike,

I was part of this testing also.  I'll see if I can expand on the subject. 
What we were doing is testing flarq operation in a digital net situation. 
We had noticed that flarq Plain Talk transmitted OK without being connected. 
The rest of the group could watch what was going on via the fldigi window. 
At one point, while two of us were connected with flarq, two more of us 
connected to each other.  All four us were in a connected state, but as two 
separate connections.  We then discovered that the flarq Plain Talk messages 
from both connections were seen on both connections.  We then began to see 
the advantages of having flarq working so everyone listening could see the 
Plain Text messages in flarq.  In running a net, some folks would have a 
difficulty reading Plain Talk text on fldigi.  From a training perspective, 
we think being able to have the entire net running flarq and handling most 
non-traffic interaction via Plain Talk would be easier than a mix of fldigi 
keyboard-to-keyboard and flarq.

With unconnected Plain Talk (or in our case, multiple connections), it 
became difficult to figure out who was sending text lines easily.  You had 
to watch the fldigi window while you were reading the cleaner looking text 
lines on flarq.  What we are asking for is Plain Talk operation both 
connected and unconnected with a call sign as the front of the line such as 
&quot;&lt;N0GW&gt;&quot;.

We realize this was not the original intent of flarq but in testing we think 
that with a very small change it could serve us very well for our tactical 
emergency messaging net operation.

I hope I made that detailed enough to know what we are shooting for.

Oh yes, we did try the fldigi/wrap operation and would use that for 
bulleting type stuff but for message passing, flarq gets stuff through under 
rougher QRN conditions.

Dave,

We did come across an a probable bug in flarq.  It appears that with flarq 
4.3AB, received email messages are dropped in the bit bucket.  Flarq says 
they are received OK but a complete search of the machine for any new files 
of any type did not turn up received emails.

So if I understand correctly, what you are asking is for FLARQ to function 
in an Instant Messenger/Chat mode for roundtables giving you the funtions 
mentioned.

Interesting idea.  FLARQ, I think, was envisioned being used to provide 
reliable copy point to point using ARQ and it works very nicely too.

It is interesting you have used the plain talk function in that way and does 
open up some ideas for the future. Or perhaps a separate program altogether.

Subject: Flarq Plain Talk, E-mail Items

Dave,

Several of us just ran a loose &quot;net&quot; using Flarq, and found that during
a roundtable it was very confusing using the plain-talk.  It would be
good if each line in the plain talk window were preceded with the
sender's callsign, something like &lt;K0OG&gt; to identify the sender.  As a
temporary help, I copied &quot;&lt;K0OG&gt;&quot; and would just Ctrl-V to paste it
prior to each line I would type.

Also, I received an e-mail message but it did not show up in the
NBEMS.files, nor any other directory structure I could find.  We are
still working on trying to figure that out - maybe I have something set
up incorrectly?  It would be nice to have a menu item or button in Flarq
to open the received e-mail and received-files directories.

I'm running AX, Windows XP Pro SP3.

Several of us in Missouri and possibly in Kansas will try some things
again at 2:00 PM, 3.585 MHz if anyone would like to drop in.

73,
-Joe-
