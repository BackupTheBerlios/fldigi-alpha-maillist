<PRE>
Yesterday I added a hard drive to my computer as a slave to the
master drive.

I first hooked that drive up as master and installed Ubuntu 9.04
as the operating system.  I then put it back as slave with the
master hooked up.  I set it up so I could boot from either drive.

I tried compiling fldigi 3.13AZ using the latest beta release of
Hamlib (I don't know if that relates to my problem or not).

Fldigi compiled O.K. with no errors but when I start fldigi
it comes up without the user interface panels (is that what
they are called?) at the top of the screen and the bottom
of the screen.  I can get the ones at the bottom to come up
by going into Configure, User Interface, Oper' Controls, and
click on 'Enable all'.  I notice that normally these are
not checked but the functions still appear anyway.
I haven't figured out a way to get the upper ones to
come up yet.

The pre-compiled binary comes up the same way as well.

In an attempt to figure this out, I re-built Hamlib from the
current release version, 1.2.9 but that didn't help.
Then I went back over all the steps and re-did everything,
but still no go.

I looked back at my backup CDs and found version 3.13AD and
tried compiling it.  It works normally with no apparent issues.

Other difference between when I first compiled fldigi and now
(Dave had told me to always get the latest revision of each
package):

package       previous rev          current rev
curl          7.19.5                7.19.6
fltk          1.1.9                 1.1.10rc2
xmlrpc-c      1.06.31               1.06.31
hamlib        1.2.9                  1.2.10svn-20091028

Don't know if any of the above could be relevant but I'm
including what info I have.

I'm about ready to re-install Ubuntu and start all over again
but use the released version of Hamlib but I'm not too
confident that will help.

Anybody have any ideas?

73, Mike, K0TER
