That requires some kind of media access control protocol (MAC). All KISS
provides is an intelligent interface between an external device (modem,
PAD) and the computer via a standard serial port. It is just a lot easier
to interface to a device using the KISS protocol than something else.

But KISS itself is just a very simple interface protocol and does not
really do anything to 'help' the actual transmission protocol.

I proposed KISS to Phil Karn back in about 1987 as a way to move the entire
protocol stack into the PC and stop using the not-very-good AX.25 code that
was common in the TNCs of the day. PCs had serial ports but the actual
USART and modem were in the TNC. KISS was a way to &quot;dumb down&quot; the TNC to
where it became much more useful for experimentation. We just needed a way
to assemble the SDLC frames for transmission and get the SDLC frames
received by the TNC into the computer without any additional processing.
That made our TCP/IP experimentation much easier.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Short of amateur multicast protocol ( AMP ) nothing else approaches the

AX.25 is not particularly efficient at anything. The bell 202 modem is
suboptimal for anything serious over-the-air. AX.25's lack of adaptive
timers makes it tend to collapse if there is any attempt to run two or more
sessions over the same channel concurrently with each session offering
traffic levels that saturate the channel. Also CSMA only works if all the
stations can hear all the other stations, not something that happens on HF.

So if you are serious, you really need to roll something new. I believe
that CSMA/CA using slot reservation shows a lot of promise. As for the
modem/waveform, I think that IFK is ideal, especially when running over
NVIS channels.

Also, ARQ on a per-packet basis is pretty inefficient. We have the ability
to buffer huge amounts of data. No reason not to send large blocks of data
and then later request retransmission of only damaged frames, i.e.
selective reject as opposed to go-back-n.

AX.25 was an interesting experiment in the 1980s. We learned a lot from it,
mostly all the ways that it is broken. :-) Time for something new.
