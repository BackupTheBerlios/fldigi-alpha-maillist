Changes from 3.21.43

3.21.43AB alpha

     Fork open file descriptors
       * Add O_CLOEXEC to all open(...) calls
       * Add &quot;e&quot; to all fopen(...) calls
       * Prevents passing open file descriptors to child
         processes.  Leaving psid's available to the child
         could cause unwanted i/o problems and possibly a
         security leak.

     Log Time ON/OFF
       * Added seconds to logged time
       * Update older records to use seconds, default 0
       * Add seconds to time sort

     WEFAX update, ported from branch 3.22
       * The tx and rx windows can be displayed separately as now, or 
embedded in the main window.
       * Added wefax tab in configuration menu.
       * Max rows number, and adif log flag now stored in configuration.
       * Destination directory can be set in configuration menu with 
Fl_File_Chooser.
       * Added option for opening tx window from main menu (Like the rx 
window).
       * Shift can ba changed, default 800. Can be set to 850 Hz for 
Deutsche Wetterdienst.
       * Wefax adif log flag now in configuration (And is memorized).
       * When clicking on a received file, the image is displayed in the 
tx window.
       * Internationalization.
       * Transmit image can be zoomed. Default zoom 50% like rx image.
       * Suppressed duplicate info messages.
       * The generated image is now really back and white.
       * Display speedup.
       * Fax can be saved in monochrome, takes less disk space.
       * New option to reduce noise on images.
       * Changed RX interface: Non-stop reception is now easier.
       * Image RX starts ten lines earlier when high correlation detected.
       * Display speed-up when zoomed.
       * Cleaner indexing of correlation buffer
       * Automatic Frequency Control.
       * LPM default value for Wefax288.
       * Set compression flag for PNG images.
       * Refined AFC (Stable frquency once an image is loaded).
       * Adjusted widgets size.
       * Lowered max image height.
       * Added image binarization.
       * Changed default image mode to monochrome.
       * Smoother slant correction
       * Adjustment to constant frequency detection (Hamburg).
       * Changed max image size.
       * Added variable threshold for binary image.
       * Added erosion/dilatation for fax enhancement (Experimental, 
disabled).
       * More information when cannot load playback WAV file.
       * Speedup waterfall display.
       * Changed wefax AFC logic for setting frequency (Median/average).
       * Fixed filenames list which was not scrollable.
       * Save more information in images metadata.
       * Change selected band for AFC detection.
       * Changed level for APT start/stop detection. Now checks several 
lines.
       * Added strformat for C-style string formatting.
       * Better AFC.
       * Default max image size is increased.
       * More information saved with fax images.
       * More filtering of empty blank images based on correlation etc...
       * Change to use phasing information to stop images.
       * Phase inversion flag is now constant.
       * Detection of apt start on four successive lines instead of 
three only.
       * Detection of apt stop on three successive lines instead of two 
only.
       * Removed apt stop frequency detection (Too many false stops).
       * Fixed bad proportion of sent faxes (They were vertically 
stretched).

     Navtex
       Port of navtex modem from 3.22 branch

     CW decoder update
       * Cooperative programming effort, W1HKJ and AG1LE
       * Added matched filter implementation using FFT convolution filter
       * Added Self Organizing Map decoding.
       * Added adjustable upper/lower detection levels
       * Added level indicators on CW digiscope
       * combined new fft-convolution filter, SOM decoder &amp; FIR filter
       * added configure controls for filter selection
       * modified CW digiscope display to show 10 dot intervals independent
         of WPM setting
       * increased CW_FIR length to 512
