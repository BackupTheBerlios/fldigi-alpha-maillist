So that only leaves you with OSS and bits/pieces of Pulse as well as
Port Audio. To be perfectly honest, I don't think anyone could help you
sort this out. 

I would suspect that you have a system audio event as the suspect in
this case.



&gt;<i> This however stops me running the binaries as port audio is needed.

</I>

What card is VoIP using or looking for ?

I had Bluetooth wanting the sound card in 9.04 and I don't even have a
Bluetooth thingie.



&gt;<i> I'm wondering if the system is changing which card is the default as I

</I>&gt;<i> I recall there was some info on how to force the order of sound cards
</I>&gt;<i> but can't locate it.
</I>

Look in the messages in Sept. 07 and it should be a reply to the lsit
from Hamish.

The method used to select a sound card in fldigi has changed since that
time and is really a moot point.



&gt;<i> So if anyone has that info plus a simple instruction set on how to set
</I>&gt;<i> up pulse audio on Ubuntu for use with fldigi I will give it a try.
</I>


I wouldn't use Pulse with fldigi unless I had no other choice. Port
Audio plays best with fldigi.

From a terminal ::

sudo apt-get build-dep fldigi

should bring in the necessary Pulse and Port audio libs needed.

You will need the Pulse Audio Volume Manager gui.




&gt;<i> Of course I choose to do my tests last night while the versions were
</I>&gt;<i> between AB  and BB so could not grab a with pulseaudio binary until
</I>&gt;<i> today.
</I>&gt;<i> BB seem OK on basic receive so far.

Still nursing a very sore hand.
