<PRE>I do not know who if anybody should or even could, be singled out for 
their work on Fldigi, BUT, I want all to know that this software is 
probably the best decoding all around software I have seen to date!  
Having used many others in the past years, I still use Fldigi to dig out 
the weak ones.

It's got to the point that many of the others try to do too much and 
fall flat on there faces when called on.  From now on it's Fldigi only 
for me.

I want to ask the authors to please do not follow the others leads and 
compromise the whole program with bloat and poor sensitivity.

I would also ask that the software be incremented as a solid working 
platform, on a more frequent basis, with the purpose of allowing others 
to be able to rely on snapshots free from the inevitable bugs introduced 
by development.  I do mind the using the development versions at all 
myself, since that is the only practical way to get good code on as many 
platforms as possible.  But I am wondering if more people would use 
Fldigi if they knew that they could rely on &quot;snapshots&quot; as more or less 
polished code up to that point in time.

Just my 2 cents.... My hats off to all the gents and gals producing the 
code!
regards
Victor  K4XTT

By the way, this software is solid as far as I can tell on the released 
version of Windows 7, 64 bit.  Fldigi 3.13AX.  I'm running multiple 
instances now on various signals within the passband.
