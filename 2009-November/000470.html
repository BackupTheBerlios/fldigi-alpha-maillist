<PRE>When I first downloaded fldigi-3.13BC.dmg it worked fine.  This morning
hamlib was failing to load with the following Event log notes:

Q: main: fldigi 3.13BC log started on Wed Nov 18 07:47:51 2009
E: show_error: hamlib_init: IO error
E: show_error: hamlib_init: IO error
E: show_error: hamlib_init: IO error

I opened the Rig Control panel and tried several times to initialize
and and it would not initialize.  With a closer look the problem seems
to be with the options under the Device selector.  The normal options
I was used to seeing were not listed. The selector only displayed
the Bluetooth options and there was nothing for my USA28X.

At this point it became semi-obvious to me that fldigi was not
seeing my Keyspan USA-28X (Serial to USB) adapter.  Maybe that is
what the Event log was trying to tell me with an IO error note.

At this point, I rebooted the iMac (OS X 10.6.2), disconnected the
Adapter&#185;s USB and plugged it in again. Started fldigi-3.13BC and Bingo
the hamlib was working perfect.

The purpose of this message is to suggest users having Hamlib or
RigCAT issues to first reboot the computer to be sure your adapter
is really connected and being recognized before messing with fldigi
settings.

Dave, you may want to consider an Event log error note saying
something like Specified Device Not Detected or No Device
Detected?  I was lost on host to address an IO error message.

All is well and 3.13BC is working FB now.
