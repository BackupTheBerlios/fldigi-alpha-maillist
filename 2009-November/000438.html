<PRE>Hi.
The random audio muting the I had with a previous Ubuntu has returned.
If I recall correctly it was one of the 8.NN versions.
Removing Pulseaudio seemed to fix it at the time.
This was an upgrade from 9.04 to 9.10 and so no Pulseaudio was
installed.
I tried installing Pulseaudio which of it's self made no difference so I
then removed portaudio which seemed to improved things in the short time
I was testing.
This however stops me running the binaries as port audio is needed.
I do have a second PCI sound card as well as the on-board sound.
As I now have the signaLink usb the second card is not actually needed
for fldigi use but is a nice to have for VoIP etc.
I'm wondering if the system is changing which card is the default as I
have had occasions when the audio has changed speakers.
I recall there was some info on how to force the order of sound cards
but can't locate it.
So if anyone has that info plus a simple instruction set on how to set
up pulse audio on Ubuntu for use with fldigi I will give it a try.

Of course I choose to do my tests last night while the versions were
between AB  and BB so could not grab a with pulseaudio binary until
today.
BB seem OK on basic receive so far.
