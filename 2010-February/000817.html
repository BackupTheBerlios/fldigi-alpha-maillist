<PRE>I'm testing fldigi v3.12.5 on a Maxbook pro, OSX 10.5.8, 2.33 GHz core 2
Duo, 2 GB 667 MHz DDR2 SDRAM.

I am a ham (extra class, AA7AS) but I mostly listen, and I do a lot of
shortwave monitoring, utility, weather stations and so forth.

One of the issues I am constantly running into is that the baud rates,
shifts and polarity of the received utility RTTY varies enormously. The only
way I've been able to find to set these values is to open the configuration
dialog and step through the options. This is extremely cumbersome and slow.

It would be hugely helpful to have pairs of keystrokes (or macro commands)
that would step the baud rate up and down, step the shift up and down, and
one keystroke to invert the current modem output polarity -- this saves
having to switch sidebands and re-tune, which again is much more effort than
a single keystroke would be.

Another possibility is to add dedicated control buttons that do this, but
that seems like overkill. At the bottom left, in the status line, you can
change the shift with the mouse, but you can't change the shift or the baud
rate.

If you add macro commands, five keys could be dedicated to this if the user
wished (and for SWL, you don't really need them for TX buffers, either) and
thgis would serve quite nicely to provide either keystroke or mouse control
to quicky and easily match the incoming rtty particulars.

If you ever need input on SSTV or FAX for fldigi, feel free to ask. I
designed AEA's AVT SSTV/FAX system and can offer knowledge here. Given what
you already have, SSTV and fax are just a few steps away - an image window,
the jpeg libs, some really basic font management for call overlay and so
forth (detail work can be done in the gimp or other image manipulation
software.)

As this is my first post, I would also like to commend the developers; this
is an awesome program.
