<PRE>N7MSD touched on this device in a post on e-ham:

&quot;This is a cable with a Prolific PL-2303X USB to RS-232 converter chip
inside and wired for Icom's CI-V connectors on various radios. The chip is
programmed to emit custom Icom manufacturer and device USB ID's, which is
why a separate driver is included in windows. In Linux, this chip is
supported but needs a small 4-line patch to insert the specific USB ID's
into the driver; I posted this to the Icom D-Star forums but never got
around to submitting it properly to the Linux kernel devs. The situation
should be equally simple for BSD folk, including you OS-X people (assuming
OS-X lets you recompile the kernel or parts of it).&quot;

If you are to use this cable you would have to do some work to get into the
kernel on OS-X.  Probably not for the faint of heart.

I am using a Prolific 2303 USB to Serial cable and have found drivers
available for OS-X searching the web.  There are a couple of
.dmg's available that make installation of the drivers a breeze.  Not sure
if these would work with this specific device or not.

It would be of interest to know if you installed the Windows drivers in the
virtual machine directly instead of letting Widows do a
search and install or simply try and recognize it.  If you did not then you
may want to try that as it appears this is a modified 2303 driver
set specific to the ICOM.

I have not searched to see if there is a Mac version of this driver
available there might be. You may want to try and contact
N7MSD directly and see if he can offer any advice.

An alternative might be to purchase a straight RS-232 cable for the ICOM and
a separate USB  converter cable with available drivers for
OS-X.

I run fldigi native and with VM Ware with XP and Linux virtual machines on
my Mac Mini and Macbook 13&quot;  although these are not the newest models, and
they run flawlessly.  I do this to help members of our SMAT team trouble
shoot setups and changes they may encounter.

If I find a driver or any other information that may help I will pass it
along.

73's
