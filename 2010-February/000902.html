<PRE>Hi.
Not noticed them before but I'm guessing they coincide with reception of
RSID signals.Sorry if I missed a log note about them.

Also I'm waiting for an emailed report of erratic AFC operation form 2
stations who were testing on 2m SSB this was apparently the windows
version of CA and got better when they reverted to the regular release.
I can report some AFC wobble on RSID signals when RSID RX was not set.
This caused the pointer to move a little, such that a click was required
to regain resolution.
Since I started this mail another RX only station has reported the AFC
issue and I have mailed him asking which version he was using.
I think the the station transmitting the RSID was using the regular
fldigi as he had toe revert due to the latest Puppy pskmail fldigi
version not liking his graphic card settings.

As I said when RSID RX was enabled reception was better.
I will report further when I have the additional info.
