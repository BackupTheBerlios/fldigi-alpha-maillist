<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>I have recently added a CAT style interface to an elderly TS-530S rig to
 capture the frequency and mode and also to key the TX. In doing so I
have found Fldigi to be quite susceptible to anything out of the
ordinary in its rig control.

I am using the RigCAT interface and a cut down FT-1000.XML file but have
had problems with a proper FT-1000 radio and the Hamlib interface too.
It seems that if anything happens out of the ordinary Fldigi freezes up
taking about 60% CPU and has to be killed from a terminal.

This is the same with the current release version running on Windows,
Ubuntu and Puppy Linux and also with the latest Alpha 3.13BY.

If the rig is turned off while Fldigi is running it freezes most times.
 If an out-of-range frequency is reported by the rig (happened a few
times while developing the interface for the TS-530) it freezes and if
there is anything wrong with the XML file again its all over until the
process is killed.

Is this something experienced by others or have I just been unfortunate
I wonder?

Best regards
