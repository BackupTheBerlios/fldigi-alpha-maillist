I'll admit to not having extensive experience with cwdaemon so this is
a rather glaring limitation especially when sending directly from the
keyboard.  For a contest logging program it's a mostly hidden issue and
the sent characters are mostly the result of a macro invocation.

Does it do the same when set to use the serial port?  I would assume
so.

Still, that doesn't mean that the cwdaemon command set is fatally
flawed, or does it?  By that I mean Fligi or some other program could
be a cwdaemon replacement to support the widest possible group of
existing software but allow extensions that future software could take
advantage of.  For the moment Linux logging programs have settled on
the cwdaemon interface.

Perhaps someone should start a Morse daemon project that addresses
cwdeamon's shortcomings.  :-)
