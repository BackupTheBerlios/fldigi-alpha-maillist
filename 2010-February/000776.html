<PRE>The problem I have with cwdaemon is that it wasn't written with editing 
in mind.  You send a character (and suppose it was a typing error and 
you are far ahead in your buffer of what is being sent).  You can't 
correct it because it has been sent to cwdeamon already, and cwdaemon 
only allows you to cancel the whole buffer, not edit it.  I looked into 
fixing this problem in Xlog, and finally gave up, figuring it would be 
much easier to start from scratch and manage the buffer totally in Xlog 
and skip cwdaemon. 

Another thing I don't like about cwdaemon is that it grabs your parallel 
port, and there have been times I wanted to use the parallel port for 
something, but forgot that cwdaemon was running, and it took me a little 
time to figure out what was going on.
