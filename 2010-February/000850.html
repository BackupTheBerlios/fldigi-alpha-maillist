<PRE>Hi all,

Have been chasing audio issues here for some time with the advent of
Ubuntu 9.10 and Linux Mint Helena (based on Ubuntu 9.10)

I have had a plethora of issues that have shown up with audio and
unless I was using fldigi and have certain requirements to operate my
station
the way it should, I might not have noticed some of these things.

After it is all said and done here is my personal feeling:

I think the use of Pusle Audio came about to make the mainstream Linux
distros, more
acceptable to the average young very heavy Audio &amp; Video oriented Windows
users.

I have no doubt that it works very well for handling all the audio and using
the individual programs functions
for audio output (most only have a volume control).

I am not sold on this approach as yet for someone like us perhaps that
desire/need a little better control of audio inputs
and outputs.

I too have noticed a reported increase in CPU use at times with these
distro's and most noticed with fldigi which is
what I use the most on my Linux boxes that use these resources.  Stands to
reason.

MY Solution  to date (still working on it)

1st:  I had become so accustomed to Linux not requiring so much RAM that as
the distros have evolved I simply didn't have enough
RAM on my older box to facilitate the High Demand.  Sooooo  I maxed out the
ram and this helped alleviate most all of the problems.
Yes, even the CPU use dropped.  (not educated enough to understand
completely why, yet)

2nd:  On the Linux Mint system I have chosen to use Port Audio and installed
the Alsa Mixer Control to maintain the
level of control I like to have over the audio for my uses.  All is working
well at this point.

3rd:  On the Ubuntu 9.10 system I am allowing Pulse Audio to continue to run
so I can learn more about it.  So far it seems
to have smoothed out and I haven't really had to many issues and of course I
am forced to use fldigi to manage the mixer which
is working well so far.

4th:  I eliminated an interrmitent ground loop in my system and placed a
toroid on the speaker wires.  I do not
understand why just yet but when using Pulse Audio this manifested as
distortion on transmit.  I did not observe
this when using Port Audio.  So I was forced to re-evaluate my Station and
in accordance with good Amateur Radio
Practices made substantive improvements in my set-up that may have caused
other problems at some point in time.

Note:  Both Mint and Ubuntu are separate bootable partitions on the same box
so all hardware is the same.

Concern:  For my portable EmComm set up's making use of older laptops
(donated and more expendable as they get some rough use)
I may have to concentrate on using less resource hungry distributions like
Puppy Linux which is working very well at this time
with the latest Alpha version.

I am not sure what all this is telling me about the future of Linux Distros
and Hardware but we do have a lot of options.

By the way Fldigi is working flawlessly on Mac OS X laptop and Mac Mini and
I haven't noticed any problems in the XP
virtual machines I am using for testing, although these are all on later
more up to date boxes which may be why.


It seems there are things we can do to help if we are to have and use Pulse
Audio up to and including purchasing
more up to date boxes.  My success with Port Audio and Mixer controls may
also be  an option for some users as well.

Not sure if this helps anyone or not but as I had voiced my frustrations
privately to Dave about Pulse Audio,
I still  continue testing to search for some solutions.


73's all

Mike
