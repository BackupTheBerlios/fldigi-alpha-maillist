</I>Stelios or Dave would know for sure, but based on the time I've spent in 
the Linux driver code, the only way to do this would be with a device 
which produces multiple independent data streams from more than one 
ADC.  Sampling at the native rate and then converting in one of the 
mid-tier APIs is the only way I am aware of, as the simple USB devices 
do not produce multiple streams of data. The EMU-0404 and EMU-1616 have 
multiple analog inputs, and produce multiple channels, but those are PCI 
devices and I don't know if you can configure them internally to split a 
single input into multiple ADC channels.

</I>The CPU load is going to be pretty much the same for all USB devices.  
So you're looking at the distortion figures and dynamic range as the 
main differentiator.   I use a Creative iMic (which is a branded version 
of a no-name; they change the chipset regularly) for fldigi, and an 
EMU-0202 for Quisk panadaptor.  The sampling rate of the '0202 is up to 
96Khz, but high sample rate isn't necessary for fldigi.

Here's N8LP's review of sound cards: 
<A HREF="http://www.telepostinc.com/soundcards.html">http://www.telepostinc.com/soundcards.html</A>
It's biased toward Windows, but many of the hardware specs should be the 
same, as I suspect he understands how to avoid software resampling.  The 
ARRL also had a two-part set of reviews in QST a year or two ago.
&gt;<i> Another thread has some discussion about the mixer elements of these USB sound
</I>&gt;<i> devices, or in this case, the lack of. Wondering how that's handled for card
</I>&gt;<i> inputs and outputs? Also seemed to not be supported in oss-alsa emulation,
</I>&gt;<i> i.e. there was no /dev/dsp1 mixer created for the card. Though I don't know if
</I>&gt;<i> the USB device was aliased correctly or not.
</I>&gt;<i>

This level of Linux sound mystifies me, though Stelios has tried to 
explain it to me several times.
