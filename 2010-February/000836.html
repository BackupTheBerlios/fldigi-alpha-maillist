Not exactly. Soundcard makers of late have been getting lazy in supplying 
hardware capable of handling all of the usual sample rates natively. Instead 
they rely on the OS to do the conversion. 44100 is CD quality, but most higher 
end cards generally support (at least) 48000 which has lower overhead in 
conversions to some other sample rates. 

For radio purposes it is better to have a stable soundcard that can support 
all of the sample rates it needs to without requiring the OS to do a 
conversion, as all conversions are not necessarily as clean as handling the 
stream at the intended sample rate in the first place. That's why some sample 
rate conversion ratios require greater overhead and produce less satisfactory 
results.

Mandriva is rock solid now in 2010.0 and up with Pulse. From some of the 
things I am seeing Ubuntu has not completely tamed Pulse as of the current 
release.

Yes, also what I see here.

&gt;<i> , and OSS seems rock solid.
</I>
Though OSS emulation will likely soon be going away and the emulation may not 
always be available. Something to keep in mind when selecting soundcards for 
Linux.

&gt;<i> As there have been quite a few Pulse-related changes since my earlier

</I>&gt;<i> installation, so I'll do some comparisons.

Ed, is working through this right now on Ubuntu. I'm not having his issues at 
all on Mandriva 2010.0.

Peter, your reply to is set to have the list replies go to you and not the 
list address.
