My question Leigh is whether or not a USB sound device can handle multiple 
sample rates natively just as a PCI card can that can support these sample 
rates natively?

I'm assuming so based on what you wrote.

I guess the question then is how to identify good USB hardware for ham use?

Another thread has some discussion about the mixer elements of these USB sound 
devices, or in this case, the lack of. Wondering how that's handled for card 
inputs and outputs? Also seemed to not be supported in oss-alsa emulation, 
i.e. there was no /dev/dsp1 mixer created for the card. Though I don't know if 
the USB device was aliased correctly or not.
