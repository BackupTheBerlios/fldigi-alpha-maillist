<PRE>Guy,

 

Agreed on the Fetch timing. I've found the same as you. if you hit &quot;Fetch&quot;
in less than a second or so from the end of the report transmission, it
usually works. But if you wait much longer you have to enter the figures
manually.

Subject: Repeater testing results

 

We did out bi-weekly on the repeater this afternoon found the following.

 

1.  No autounkey when a report is sent.

2.  I still has issues with flamp and flmsg running at the same time.  This
may not be fixed yet, I do not remember.  I know Dave went on something
called a vacation.  I do not remember what those are.

3.  Is it normal operation for only the last report to be fetched?  I had 3
stations send me reports.  Only the last one was fetched.  This was more for
testing than what we may do in real world.  

4.  We think we found 2 timing issues.  First one was when resending missing
blocks.  Both my station and another station would miss the first block if
the Xmt rpt was sent to 1.  The rest of the missing blocks would be
received.  Setting xmt rpt to 3 fixed that problem.  We could somewhat
repeat that problem.  Not everyone saw it.  That was the annoying part.

5.  Second timing issue is the fetch button.  If a station waited to longer
say 2 or 3 seconds after receiving a report before clicking on fetch, the
station could not fetch the missing reports block.

 

We ran PSK250RC6 today and that was smooth sailing.

 

Thank you for the work Dave.
