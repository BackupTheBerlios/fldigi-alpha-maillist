<PRE>Some possible suggestions for improvement:

1.
So that I can use my rigs (IC-7600) RTTY and CW filters, I need a macro
command that will on activation of the macro key send the rigmode command
immediately. Presently the rigmode change command seems to go into the TX
buffer and consequently only executes when a TX is requested.

This way, I could have macros such as &quot;rxCW&quot; : which just has
&lt;RIGMODE:CW&gt;&lt;RX&gt; and &quot;txCW&quot; with &lt;RIGMODE:USBD1&gt;&lt;TX&gt; - this second one
already works but the essential first one does not.
Then I can use the rigs filters on RX and use the AFSK mode to send CW.
This would also allow the use of the rigs RTTY filters. I have tried a
macro such as &quot; &lt;RIGMODE:RTTY&gt;&lt;TX&gt;&lt;RX&gt; &quot; but the rig stays in TX mode and
the immediate RX command is ignored.

2.
When the QSY button is pressed, or the rig frequency is changed, the
browser and channel displays should immediately clear/refresh. Also the
current channel that one has QSYed to should be correctly highlighted
instead of leaving the old one active.

3.
Minor changes to the flrig interface for the ic-7600 could allow for a
button for autonotch, the present notch command uses the manual mode; and a
button to change antenna, this last one would be useful when working
remotely from the rig.

4.
Finally a way to send on init and close down of both flrig and fldigi a set
of custom CAT commands to initialise the rig to a known fixed state, not
the remembered state from last use, and to be able on exit to set back to
another fixed state, but not that one active on the start up on the
programmes. flrig has a way to send a one time custom command but this is
not remembered and has to be manually entered so does not serve the purpose.

Thanks again for these two great programmes.
