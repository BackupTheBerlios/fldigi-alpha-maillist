<PRE>  LoS VHF/UHF comms was what I had on my mind, too... especially FM 
simplex or repeaters. We have MANY more operators with VHF FM 
capabilities as compared to HF or SSB VHF ops at our disposal and 
VHF/UHF FM (simplex or repeated) would really be our bread and butter 
for emergency radio communications in my part of the world.

In Western Pennsylvania, we're concentrating on the use of MT63 2k long 
interleave, which really works fantastic on the line of sight paths and 
on repeaters. We chose MT63 over the faster PSK250 and 500 for it's 
ability to loose up to almost a full second of audio without missing a 
beat as a result of the massive amount of FEC in the mode. BUT, we're 
only utilizing about half of the usable bandpass of an analog FM signal. 
It sure would be nice to double or triple our throughput and still come 
close to maintaining the current reliability and robustness of MT63 2k 
long. On FM, there is not the typical trade off on bandwidth vs accuracy 
you have with SSB... we're just not fully utilizing the 4.5k usable 
bandwidth at our disposal.

</I>The problem is, HF propagation through the ionosphere is NOT a
gaussian-noise-limited channel. Fast PSK does NOT usually fare well over
HF.

FWIW it would be good for LoS VHF/UHF communications.

If you are interested in fast datacomm over HF you need to study what has
been accomplished with PACTOR and WinMOR.
