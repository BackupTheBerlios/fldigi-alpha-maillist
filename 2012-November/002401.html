<PRE>We were doing our bi-weekly net today with most users on 3.21.61EXP01
today.  Most are Win 7 but a few are on XP including myself.  We were
seeing the = sign in the Rx pane but the message in Flmsg was clean.  We
tried and got the same in MT632k and PSK500R.

Dave, is that indicating a tab?  I have not noticed it before.  Where the =
sign is happens to be where I pressed tab when I was drafting the message.

We were also seeing consistency issues with RSID.  It was an either all or
nothing with decode.  I have not tried to verify in Linux.  I blew up my
linux box this morning trying to fix an issue with GLIB 2.15.

3 stations including myself had crashes of Fldigi at the end of a
successful receive but I have not found a way to cause it to happen yet so
I have not data beyond crashing at the end of rx.
