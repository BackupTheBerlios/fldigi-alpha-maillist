<PRE>I played around in the ARRL VHF QSO Party over the weekend
and logged the QSO&#185;s in fldigi-3.21.0AE using the recently added
option to log SSB QSOs.

The logging worked fine; however, I encountered some format
issues when I exported the QSO&#185;s in Cabrillo format.

After several passes with the nagging ARRL robot, I finally
earned the 

     [4105270.arrl-vhf-jun] AA5VU

that says the robot accepted my log with no errors.

Lessons learned:

Fldigi saved my QSO frequencies correct in the logbook, like
50.12500 for SSB and 146.5500 for a 2-meter QSO&#185;s; however,
the exported Cabrillo file dropped the decimal point and that tilted
the robot. For this contest, the robot wanted whole numbers like
50 and 144. I changed Cabrillo file to whole numbers and it sill
objected to 146 (for 146.550) so I had to change it to 144 &#173; the
only number the robot would accept for the 2-meter band.

For reasons I do not understand, the robot would not accept my
callsign using the fldigi convention of

# The callsign used during the contest.
CALLSIGN: AA5VU

I went to school on the robot&#185;s rejection note and guessed it
could be a case sensitive issue and this worked

Callsign: AA5VU

I then edited on all items in the fldigi generated template to
appease the robot. I then double checked the Cabrillo QSO
templates at

<A HREF="http://www.kkn.net/~trey/Cabrillo_v2/arrl-vhf.txt">http://www.kkn.net/~trey/Cabrillo_v2/arrl-vhf.txt</A>

and it fldigi follows the example but the robot did not. I then
check with N8NOE who used another program to generate his
Cabrillo format and it used all uppercase. The robot accepted
his file. Go figure?  I still don&#185;t understand what was happening.

Finally, my SSB logged QSO&#185;s showed up as RY in the Cabrillo
export so I changed change them all to PH that was expected for
this contest.

Head up the next time you need to export a Cabrillo format.
