Mike, 

Your suggested approach will work; however,  I prefer to test each new
release by using it the way I use it everyday.

When I was in the software business, I had a saying that the enemy of good
was better and the test of any new software update was that it needed to
allow users to do what they used to do and include some new and/or better
features they may want to try.

In the case of 3.21.0AF to 3.20.17 I got burned by just installing the
newer version. This was the first time since becoming an fldigi alpha tester
I have encountered xml incompatibilities.  It is best for the alpha testers
to encounter the incompatibles rather than having them show up after
a release.

I have now started over as new user with fresh fldigi_def.xml file. It has
been a pain to remember and reset all of my personal preferences.  This
is not a bid deal for an alpha tester and is a good refresher for what new
users experience.  I just sent Dave another tip that he may want to
consider for the some future release regarding the transmitter ID or Video
Preamble for CW, PSK31 and RTTY.  Starting over caused me to find something
that Dave may want to change on one of the default configuration panels.
