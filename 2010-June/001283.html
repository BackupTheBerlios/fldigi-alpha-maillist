<PRE>Dave,
 
Would it be possible to open the WEFAX receive viewer window in place of
both the normal receive and transmit windows?
It seems like a waste of real estate to have to open another window. Also
would it be possible to &quot;lock&quot; the WEFAX receive bandpass bars to what the
decoder is looking for? This would make tuning a lot easier if we could use
the waterfall with some actual &quot;markers&quot; like the other modes make use of.
If this can't be done, could we make the WEFAX decoder operate like the
other decoders, and pass the center frequency value to the decoder so that
we could adjust the balck/white levels (and the other elements) relative to
the decoder bandpass? The &quot;sweet spot&quot; for my radio is not up at 1900 Hz and
the audio passband starts to drop off at around 2000Hz with the 2kHz filter
in-line. It would be much better if we could shift the decoder center down
to 1500 Hz (or so - in my case). Also the tuning bars added to the latest
WEFAX don't really help as the time constant is too short and they bounce
around from nothing to full scale. Adding about 10 seconds of time
integration to the reading would stabilize the indications and allow these
to be more useful as a tuning indicator.
 
The prefs file does indicate &quot;23&quot;, but on reopening fldigi, it is not
recognized as IOC576.
 
I'll download and install the 0AE later tonigh and give it a run for the
money! :)
 
BTW I love letting the program just sit on the WEFAX and pull in the Faxes!
Being an avid boater, I did not have this capability on my boat, but I could
tune the IC-710-M to any frequency (I had it &quot;opened up&quot; for Ham use also),
but I didn't have the ability to capture the WEFAX images.
 
One other &quot;Honey-Do&quot; - If we are sitting on a WEFAX channel and detect a 75
baud RTTY/850 Hz, why not switch to RTTY decode for the broadcasts and
capture those as text also? This would probably need another thread to
monitor the RX bandpass and detect the mode being used and activate the
correct decoder/modem.

Thanks,

Guys,

In WEFAX I cannot &quot;save&quot; the mode and frequency to the memorized frequency
list, when recalled it always shows PSK31( could be default).
I addition, I am having a problem with decoding the RTTY 850 Hz shift even
when set for 100 baud - 1.5 stop bits and Baudot code (5-level)



Thanks,
Mitch Baum / AF2M


What broadcast are you copying the 850 Hz on Mitch?

Dave
