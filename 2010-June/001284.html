<PRE>Hi Mitch,

&gt;<i> Dave,

</I> &gt; It seems like a waste of real estate to have to open another window.

There has been some reflection about the decision to create these two 
windows, here are some elements:
- It was needed to have a fully scrollable window. The normal receive 
window does not provide that. Many other widgets are necessary for fax only.
- It was massively inspired from sending/receivign MFSK images.
- In order to reuse the existing window, many changes are necessary in 
code which is used by all other modes so it is a bit dangerous (At this 
time, 99% of the fax logic is in two files so it is safe for the rest of 
the code).
- I thought also about writing text to these two windows, for example 
when an image is received (Maybe some quick OCR scan of the fax ?). Or, 
give the possibility to send free text by fax, just like Hell. This 
would decrease the feeling that display space is wasted as you pointed out.

What you describe would be easier if there is an easy way to insert the 
fax receive window in the normal window (and hide it when not in fax 
mode), without changing anything else. Same for the transmit window.T 
his needs reflection but you have a point in my opinion.


&gt;<i> Also would it be possible to &quot;lock&quot; the WEFAX receive bandpass bars to 
</I>&gt;<i> what the decoder is looking for? This would make tuning a lot easier if 
</I>&gt;<i> we could use the waterfall with some actual &quot;markers&quot; like the other 
</I>&gt;<i> modes make use of.
</I>- In my opinion you are right too, the thing is that I did not fully 
understand how the bandpass bars work and how they can be controlled. 
Other people had about the same idea. An alternative is to freeze the 
bandpass bar like in MT63 but I did not find how to do it at the moment.

&gt;<i> If this can't be done, could we make the WEFAX decoder operate like the 
</I>&gt;<i> other decoders, and pass the center frequency value to the decoder so 
</I>&gt;<i> that we could adjust the balck/white levels (and the other elements) 
</I>&gt;<i> relative to the decoder bandpass? The &quot;sweet spot&quot; for my radio is not 
</I>&gt;<i> up at 1900 Hz and the audio passband starts to drop off at around 2000Hz 
</I>&gt;<i> with the 2kHz filter in-line. It would be much better if we could shift 
</I>&gt;<i> the decoder center down to 1500 Hz (or so - in my case).
</I>Sorry for the question: I do not understand why it cannot be done simply 
be tuning ? Normally the frequency does not have to change much, does it ?

&gt;<i> Also the tuning 
</I>&gt;<i> bars added to the latest WEFAX don't really help as the time constant is 
</I>&gt;<i> too short and they bounce around from nothing to full scale. Adding 
</I>&gt;<i> about 10 seconds of time integration to the reading would stabilize the 
</I>&gt;<i> indications and allow these to be more useful as a tuning indicator.
</I>
wefax/wefax.cpp : return decayavg( avg_pwr, pwr, 10 );

Yes this coefficient (10) could be increased. The current level seems to 
be OK as far as I could see, but as you said it could certainly be 
tunable. Config parameter ?


&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> The prefs file does indicate &quot;23&quot;, but on reopening fldigi, it is not 
</I>&gt;<i> recognized as IOC576.
</I>Strange. Does it work fine with the other modes ? With the other 
parameters ? (Parameters related or not to WEFAX) Thanks.
&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> I'll download and install the 0AE later tonigh and give it a run for the 
</I>&gt;<i> money! :)
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> BTW I love letting the program just sit on the WEFAX and pull in the 
</I>&gt;<i> Faxes! Being an avid boater, I did not have this capability on my boat, 
</I>&gt;<i> but I could tune the IC-710-M to any frequency (I had it &quot;opened up&quot; for 
</I>&gt;<i> Ham use also), but I didn't have the ability to capture the WEFAX images.
</I>
About receiving many faxes, it would be to fine-tune the detection of 
the end of an image. The logic at the moment is based on two things:
- Detected the APT stop frequency.
- If the frequency cannot be extracted, use the power/noise ratio at APT 
stop frequency, and stop image reception if this is &quot;strong enough&quot;. The 
difficulty is in adjusting &quot;string enough&quot; which is variable depending 
on everything. I thought about an assisted mode:
- This would start as it is now.
- But when the user stops reception, we would conclude that the current 
levels mean &quot;image stop&quot;. This would give the right power thresholds 
when receiving the next image on the same frequency. Same logic for 
image start. This is quite complicated of course, the user-levels wold 
have to be saved somewhere, it would have to be tested in many different 
cases etc...

&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> One other &quot;Honey-Do&quot; - If we are sitting on a WEFAX channel and detect a 
</I>&gt;<i> 75 baud RTTY/850 Hz, why not switch to RTTY decode for the broadcasts 
</I>&gt;<i> and capture those as text also? This would probably need another thread 
</I>&gt;<i> to monitor the RX bandpass and detect the mode being used and activate 
</I>&gt;<i> the correct decoder/modem.
</I>
The difficulty is that two different modes, as you said, must be 
monitored at the same time, which is not in the logic of fldigi AFAIK.

Wonder whether it would be possible to &quot;conditionnaly&quot; set a mode with 
macros. That is, we would say:
&quot;Set mode to wefax and wait 20 seconds, then return if nothing is 
detected, otherwise stay in this mode&quot;. Same for rtty, maybe with a 
command like &lt;MODE:WEFAX:20&gt;

Thanks for your remarks.

Cheers

Remi






There might be several ways to do that:
- When no signal is detected in wefax mode, automatically switch  to
