This is the first time I have ever seen a real incompatibility. I am not
sure how to maintain two versions of the fldigi_def.xml file.

Having to start over with a new fldigi_def.xml fie for each revision is
a pain to reset the fonts, logs etc. The Wizard for new users only does
very basic stuff.  I have to remember and reset my fonts and preferred
waterfall settings.

</I>&gt;<i> If you saved a configuration in 3.21.0AF and then started 3.20.17 you
</I>&gt;<i> can expect that the last saved mode will not be correct.  That is
</I>&gt;<i> because new modes (WEFAX) have been added to 3.21.0AF.  That causes a
</I>&gt;<i> translation in the mode tables.
</I>
Then there is something wrong with the tables.

I probably need to trash 3.21.0AF and wait for the next alpha release. Like
Windows, I don't do WEFAX and that seems to be the only item excluded from
the 3.20.17 release.

I am starting over with 3.20.17 as a new user and it came up with THOR
as the default; however, this time I was able to set to RTTY and it was
saved to the fldigi_def.xml file.

I am not sure WEFAX is worth all these problems.
