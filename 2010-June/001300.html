<PRE>With all the wonderful things Mac OSX brings us there are still some things
it doesn't do as well as other OS's.

Regardless of OS being used, I learned early on as an Alpha tester to be
prepared to delete or rename the current config file especially if one
encounters strange behaviors not previously seen.

It can be inconvenient at times but if we are to contribute to the
successful growth of the various programs and contibute to furthering the
art and science of Amateur Radio in this way it comes with the territory.

I do most all my testing on the Macbook and leave my Mini working stable
releases.

One approach for Mac testers could be to set up another account on the Mac
that is used for testing only and keep the main account for stable releases.

Just a thought.

Having to start over with a new fldigi_def.xml fie for each revision is
a pain to reset the fonts, logs etc. The Wizard for new users only does
very basic stuff.  I have to remember and reset my fonts and preferred

I probably need to trash 3.21.0AF and wait for the next alpha release. Like
Windows, I don't do WEFAX and that seems to be the only item excluded from
the 3.20.17 release.

I am starting over with 3.20.17 as a new user and it came up with THOR
as the default; however, this time I was able to set to RTTY and it was
saved to the fldigi_def.xml file.

I am not sure WEFAX is worth all these problems.
