<PRE>I was running fldigi-3.20.17.dmg and had to change back
to fldigi-3.21.0AF.dmg for what started as ungraceful rig
control failures and later tuned into what I suspect may
ben an issue with how 3.20.17 writes or reads the
fldigi_def.xml file.

The problems started when I was in 3.20.17 in SSB mode
logging a brief six meter opening.  All of a sudden I got
spinning beach ball (Mac slang for a fldigi application hang).
I finally had to use the Mac OS X Force Quit to clear the hang
and when I tried to start 3.20.17 again, it hung again.  It was
hanging while trying to write an event to the event log.

I rebooted (a Mac restart) and got 3.20.17 to run then it hung
again due to a rig control failure and I use hamlib that has
been working FB.  I then reverted to fldigi-3.21.0AF.dmg and
it worked perfect with hamlib.

Since everything was working okay with the old alpha version,
I quit and tried to 3.20.17 again and it took FOREVER to start
and generated the attached  status_log.txt error message that
says:

E: show_error: Get Mode: Communication timed out

I then had a hard time exiting 3.21.17.  Again, it seemed to
take forever to close. I restarted using the older
fldigi-3.21.0AF.dmg and it failed for the same reason.

Upon examination of the fldigi_def.xml file, I suspected there may
be an issue with the way 3.21.17  was writing or reading the Saved
Configuration preferences to the file.

As a test, I trashed the fldigi_def.xml file and used a backup save
from before the 3.20.17 release that worked perfect with 3.21.0AF.
When I did a restart using 3.21.0AF, all worked fine. I was not sure
if being in SSB mode may have caused the problem so I changed to
RTTY and Saved the Configuration.  Fldigi 3.21.0AF then restarted
perfect.  

Figuring I may have just had a bad fldigi_def.xml file, I then
restarted using 2.20.17 and noticed it came up in THOR 5 mode
rather than the saved RTTY.  I then changed the mode to RTTY
and Saved the Config again.... assuming 3.20.17 would write
RTTY to the fldigi_def.xml file.  I quit and tried to restart 3.20.17
and it came up in THOR 5 (that I have never used).

I suspect there may be an issue in 3.20.17 on the way it writes
or reads the fldigi_def.xml file and don&#185;t understand why it opens
in THOR 5 &#173; that I never use?

FYI, I have reverted to fldigi-3.21.0AF.dmg for daily use and it
has been working good.  Needless to say I am a little gun shy of 3.20.17.

Has anyone notice an issue with the way 3.20.17 writes or
reads the fldigi_def.xml file?
