I would, except that the 3.21.10 package for Debian now fails with the
same error I reported to this list last month about getMenuItem
failures.  Fldigi exits with a stack trace at this point.  Fortunately,
WE0A advised that compiling locally and disabling NLS allowed Fldigi to
run for him.  So I guess it's back to local compiles until this is
sorted.

I recall that when I tried a new profile with some version of Fldigi
that I no longer have that the Hamlib PTT button was greyed out as you
describe but with my old config it was fine and working.  Then I tried
a local build of 3.21.9 and got the menu issue.  Fortunately, Kamal's
3.21.9 package worked which was updated last week so I'm without Fldigi
again.

And, yes, I do try the latest Hamlib releases since I've taken on being
the Hamlib release manager role.

&gt;<i> I don't think the Hamlib PTT option in fldigi should be dimmed out.
</I>
I agree since I've just reviewed the Hamlib sources and the TS-590 calls
the same kenwood_set_ptt function that the K3 backend calls and Hamlib
PTT was working in 3.21.9 for me.

I'll try building my own copy of Fldigi and report back.
