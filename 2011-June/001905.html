Nate N0NB,

Your comments about the K3 working inspired me to try something different 
and it helped!  Since fldigi-3.21.11 does not have a Hamlib backend for the
TS-590S, I was using the TS-570S backend that worked with my TS-570S. For
grins I tried to setup Hamlib again but this time I picked the K3 from the 
rig selector. It did not work but the &quot;Good News&quot; was by selecting the K3 it
CLEARED the dimmed PTT option!  I then tried the TS-570S option again and 
it is no longer dimmed but still does not key the rig.  Fldigi thinks it is transmitting
and the output shows on the waterfall, the red LED on the face of the TS-590S
is lit but the rig is not transmitting. 

Can you provide Dave a new backend for the TS-590S? 

What Kenwood (or other) backend would you suggest as being close to the 
new backend you prepared for the TS-590S in the new Hamlib version?

I have messed with Hamlib options so much I may have something set
incorrect that is preventing fldigi from keying the TS-590S.  I tried 
running at 57.6 Baud and that did not help.

The GOOD NEWS is the Hamlib PTT option is no longer inactive in my setup!

Having a working RigCAT configuration is a blessing until I get Hamlib keying the TS-590.

I am geting close to a solution.

Thank you for jumping though all of the hoops.
