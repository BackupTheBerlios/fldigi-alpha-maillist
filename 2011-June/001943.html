&gt;<i> I just wanted to report that we used Fldigi Alpha 3.22.0AD for Field Day, and it worked flawlessly for us.  We have used Fldigi the previous two years for FD, but were able to get more operators on digi modes this year, and all were very comfortable with it.  We used it on a laptop, WinXP, Kenwood TS-440SAT (no CAT option).  I set up some macros to get started, and other users had no problem &quot;fine tuning&quot; the macros until we had a really nice smooth operation.

Sorry Joe, W0GS is not in my log but fldigi-3.22.0AD worked perfect with the iMac and 
the Kenwood TS-590S.   

The only glitch I ran into was when the dupe checker could not catch the dupes between 
RTTY and PSK-31 on the same band. I think some of the FD stations started out with PSK31
then changed over to RTTY.  I just had to be careful.  I do not consider this as an fldigi
issue.

I used the fldigi Logbook/Reports/CSV option and Excel to come up with the totals that
could be used to fill out  the ARRL 2011 Field Day Entry Form at 

<A HREF="http://www.b4h.net/cabforms/fielddayentry.php">http://www.b4h.net/cabforms/fielddayentry.php</A>

The form calculates your score.  It was fun and fldigi worked great. The new, soon to be 
released, TX Attenuator was really nice. I kept the TS-590's S-meter set for ALC and when 
it started showing up, it was easy to tap it down with the keyboard shortcut Dave provided.

My 3830 summary is appended showing 131 QSO's (32 CW, 98 Digital and 1 Phone QSO).  
As noted in summary, the totals have been filed with the ARRL and all QSO's have been 
uploaded to LoTW using the fldigi .adif log file.
