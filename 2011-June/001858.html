No, they do not. In fact, we don't really need a knob for VFO frequency at
all, at least not with digital modes. The problem that just about everyone
is having here is the idea that the VFO is a primary control and therefore
needs a specific knob to control it. This is not really the case. The
primary control is output frequency, for which we currently have no specific
knob. We determine the output frequency by changing two knobs -- audio
&quot;carrier&quot; frequency and VFO frequency, not just one. What I would really
like is proper output frequency display and a logical combination of
controls so that, in effect, I have only a single control for output
frequency. The VFO frequency display on the front of fldigi is nothing more
than a duplicate of the one on the front of the transceiver and is therefore
a waste of display real-estate. The emission frequency is much more useful
because that is what I need to compare to things like channels centers and
band edges.

Continuing in this vein, I am imagining that I set output frequency directly
on the fldigi waterfall. Wherever I put the cursor I see that actual
emission frequency in the frequency display. The software manipulates both
VFO frequency and audio subcarrier frequency for me and I don't need to


&gt;<i> Would a bigger font for the qso frequency field (the first one of the
</I>&gt;<i> log fields) be enough of an improvement for you ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Why? I want a display that is always updated and not tied to the logging
display, a display that tells me precisely the frequency of my RF emissions.

Perhaps a switch for the primary frequency display to allow it to display
actual frequency or VFO frequency.
