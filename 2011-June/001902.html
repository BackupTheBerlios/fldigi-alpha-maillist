<PRE>First, the good news is fldigi-3.21.11.dmg works with my Kenwood TS-590S 
using, the direct USB interface to an iMac using the Silicon Labs USB-to-UART 
VPC Driver - provided I use the fldigi RigCAT option for rig control. 

The bad news is I have not been able to get the Hamlib option for rig control 
in fldigi to key or cause the TS-590S to transmit. I suspect the reason it will not 
transmit is the Hamlib option for &quot;PTT via hamlib command&quot; is checked but the 
option is dimmed or not active in the fldigi configuration panel. 

Dave W1HKJ, has not been able to duplicate problem most likely because he 
does have a Kenwood TS-590S and may not use a direct USB interface in his 
development setup.

One guess was the problem could be related to the Silicon Labs USB to UART 
VPC driver used by Kenwood for the TS-590S and Icom for the IC-7410; however,
RigCAT does not have an issue with this driver. For this reason I tend to discount 
the SL USB-to-UART as the problem child.

I had no problem using the Hamlib interface when I used the SignaLink USB 
via the TS-590's Acc2 port. Keying the rig was handled by the Auto-PTT circuit
in the SignaLink USB.  There was no reason for me to check the box to 
&quot;PTT via Hamlib command&quot; and I never noticed if it was dimmed or active. 

I first noticed the inactive or dimmed out PTT option when took the SignaLink 
out of line and went to the direct USB interface for audio and rig control. When 
Hamlib would not transmit, I switch over to RigCAT that works but does not 
report VFO-B frequencies for DX split operations.

When Dave W1HKJ could not duplicate the problem, I assumed there may 
something wrong with my setup so I started over as a new user. I let the fldigi 
Wizard do its thing and when it presented the rig control options, the PTT option 
was not dimmed in Hamlib. I selected it and when I pushed the red initialize button,
fldigi crashed - hung - big time and I had to use the OS X Force Quit to escape. 
When I restarted, the PTT option was checked but the option was dimmed and 
fldigi could not key the rig.

I have seen notes from Nate N0NB about a new version of Hamlib. Has the
new version been tested with fldigi? I wonder if the new version will correct
the noted PTT issue. Nate indicated Hamlib keys his K3 via a USB using his 
old .fldigi folder but I don't know how his K3 setup relates to a Kenwood. 

Someone mentioned there could be a port ownership issue with RigCAT or
the Mac OS owning the USB port and not releasing for use by Hamlib. I have no 
way to assess or test for port ownership. I could not get Hamlib to work as 
a new user.

Has any member of fldigi alpha team recently tested the Hamlib option to &quot;PTT 
via Hamlib control&quot; via a USB port?

Anyone else using one of the Silicon Labs USB to UART drivers with Hamlib
for Window, Linux and Mac OS X?

How about some feedback from another fldigi Kenwood TS-590S or Icom 
IC-7410 user with the USB interface?

I am open to any suggestion to get Hamlib working with the Kenwood TS-590S 
USB interface. 

I don't think the Hamlib PTT option in fldigi should be dimmed out.
