<PRE>Hi Jim,

A couple of questions please:
- Was the signal good?
- Did it happen only and a while, or each time ?
- Does it happen with other stations?
- Is there something unusual with this station?
- Was your radio properly tuned?

As far as I remember, at the beginning of an image, there is a phase 
which is similar to APT STOP, and maybe this is what was detected.

It is not a 100% reliable process to detect image transitions, anyway.

If this happens regularly, it might be worth to fully understand this 
bad behaviour and add some logic, which could be for example:
- When the user has clicked 'Skip phasing', assume that an image is 
being sent, and first listen to the signal a couple of seconds before 
stopping reception.
- Ensure a minimum timing after phasing or APT start, before assuming 
that an image end is detected.
- Maybe tune the detection levels (Have them customizable?)

But again, this extra logic is difficult to tune, and might have 
annoying side effects, so it might be preferrable if you do not mind, to 
be 100% sure of the root cause of the problem.

Thanks anyway for this interesting remark!

PS: In the next fldigi release, it will be possible to send and receive 
fax images with XML-RPC.

&gt;<i> I just tried WEFAX after ignoring it for quite a while. Was trying to
</I>&gt;<i> copy the station on 8502 KHz. A transmission was in progress, and while
</I>&gt;<i> they were sending the white part of a page the green picture bar was fully
</I>&gt;<i> lit up. But when I punched SKIP APT and then SKIP PHASING it would almost
</I>&gt;<i> immediately jump back to the place where SKIP APT is displayed. I had to
</I>&gt;<i> use MANUAL to get it to keep receiving. Wonder if anyone else is having
</I>&gt;<i> this kind of problem.
