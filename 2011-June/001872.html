<PRE>Actually, I think we should decouple the UI from the modem and services 
(logging, spotting, etc) set and use a protocol between them.  I've done 
a couple of versions of this in the past, and believe that an HTTP based 
approach is the right one now.  (It's not quite what we have with 
XML-RPC, but similar.  I'm not going to complain about something that 
works and is easy to author, and don't think we should move away from 
it, but it's not a good play for the interoperable web space and across 
different digimode application.)  Right nowI'm working with a few other 
people who've had this same idea.  The main reason I propose this is 
because it lets the modem and software-hard developers do their thing 
best, and lets the UI designers do what they do.  So, instead of a 
&quot;fork&quot; of fldigi, if we had this type of approach, it'd be a new 
front-end client to fldigi.

I realize this isn't an overnight change, and so I'm continuing to work 
on it in the background.  A common control protocol would mean that 
front ends could work with multiple different programs, and I think it's 
quite likely that with or without us (us, me, fldigi, et al) this will 
come to pass anyway.

As an example of what this might enable, I believe that a PSK Reporter 
like UI as for a digimode program is an enchanting idea, and might 
appeal to a different set of people than the current style of digimode 
UI, which range from MultiPSK's highly utilitiarian to HRD Deluxe's Mad 
Scientist.  There's no reason someone who wants to do a different UI 
(map-based UI or a cloud-text UI, or even like KI6IMM who wants an 
xboard front end so he can play chess over the air) should have to deal 
with a complex modem system or C++ or Pascal (MultiPSK) or anything at 
all remotely like that.  In fact, I think an HTML+JS based UI, or an 
Apple or Android toolkit UI should be trivially possible, and each will 
appeal to a different set of people as users and as developers.

</I>&gt;<i> Once you make that leap then perhaps what I am talking about begins to

</I>&gt;<i> and audio subcarrier. The setting of that control would then be 
</I>&gt;<i> reflected in the display of emission center frequency. Yes, all of 
</I>&gt;<i> this already appears in one fashion or another in fldigi as it stands. 
</I>&gt;<i> I am just pushing everyone to start thinking about a different way of
