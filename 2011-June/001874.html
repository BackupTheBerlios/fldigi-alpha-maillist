I think you are right on and starting to think in terms of an integrated
system. I am not sure that I would pick HTTP other than it certainly is
ubiquitous.


&gt;<i> Right nowI'm working with a few other people who've had this same idea.
</I>&gt;<i>  The main reason I propose this is because it lets the modem and
</I>&gt;<i> software-hard developers do their thing best, and lets the UI designers do
</I>&gt;<i> what they do.  So, instead of a &quot;fork&quot; of fldigi, if we had this type of
</I>&gt;<i> approach, it'd be a new front-end client to fldigi.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
That does make a lot of sense. I am thinking in terms of how the system
presents itself to the user and that is independent of the way it works
under the hood but I suspect that how you think about the system is going to
leak into the implementation.

I think you need to go one step further. What we are really talking about is
thinking of the &quot;modems&quot; (I prefer CODECs) as plug-ins to our communications
system. We blur or completely eliminate the dividing line between the IF
(the rig) and the CODEC (fldigi) until it functions as a single entity. That
is the direction we are going. Right now because we have two pieces of
hardware, i.e. rig and computer, we think they are really separate. They
aren't. Heck, many years ago a top-notch receiver was a tunable IF at one
frequency, something like 40m, and then we used receiving converters ahead
of that to get the bands we wanted. I am sure that everyone was thinking
back then that these were separate. Then Collins came along with the KWM1
and made it all look so simple and integrated. Sure the converters still
existed in there but now you just didn't see them or have to do the
frequency calculations in your head. It became one receiving system and the
operator's life was easier. In fact, what I am talking about is
*IDENTICAL*to that situation. We have a low tunable IF (fldigi) and a
higher tunable IF
(the rig). Instead of tuning them separately we have a single &quot;knob&quot; to tune
everything at once.


&gt;<i> I realize this isn't an overnight change, and so I'm continuing to work on
</I>&gt;<i> it in the background.  A common control protocol would mean that front ends
</I>&gt;<i> could work with multiple different programs, and I think it's quite likely
</I>&gt;<i> that with or without us (us, me, fldigi, et al) this will come to pass
</I>&gt;<i> anyway.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes, it probably will.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As an example of what this might enable, I believe that a PSK Reporter like
</I>&gt;<i> UI as for a digimode program is an enchanting idea, and might appeal to a
</I>&gt;<i> different set of people than the current style of digimode UI, which range
</I>&gt;<i> from MultiPSK's highly utilitiarian to HRD Deluxe's Mad Scientist.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yeah, speaking of how to go completely overboard without any sort of thought
about system structure ...


&gt;<i> There's no reason someone who wants to do a different UI (map-based UI or a
</I>&gt;<i> cloud-text UI, or even like KI6IMM who wants an xboard front end so he can
</I>&gt;<i> play chess over the air) should have to deal with a complex modem system or
</I>&gt;<i> C++ or Pascal (MultiPSK) or anything at all remotely like that.  In fact, I
</I>&gt;<i> think an HTML+JS based UI, or an Apple or Android toolkit UI should be
</I>&gt;<i> trivially possible, and each will appeal to a different set of people as
</I>&gt;<i> users and as developers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
You are one step further along than where I was starting with this.
