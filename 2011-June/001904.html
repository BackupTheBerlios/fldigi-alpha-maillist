<PRE>Here are my observations.

I was able to get a working Fldigi on my Debian Sid (Unstable) box with
the --disable-nls switch to configure.

I fired up Fldigi with my old config and confirmed that Hamlib PTT was
enabled and that PTT via Hamlib worked.  Yes on both counts.

I then moved ~/.fldigi (configuration directory) out of the way
temporarily and let Fldigi create a new config directory.  When I got to
the Rig Control screen I selected the Hamlib tab, set the rig model and
serial adapter and clicked Initialize.  Then I clicked Finish but had no
VFO frequency display.  Oops!  I went back into Rig Control and actually
selected Use Hamlib at the top and noted that the Hamlib PTT checkbox
was checked by grayed out.  Still, Hamlib PTT to the K3 worked.

I deleted ~/.fldigi, went through the set up procedure again this time
making sure to also select the Use Hamlib checkbox the first time
through.  I confirmed Hamlib PTT was working and went back into the
configuration dialog to find the Hamlib PTT checkbox was not grayed out.
Repeated selections of the dialog and restarting Fldigi showed the
checkbox to be active each time.

What I failed to do was to keep the config directory when the checkbox
was grayed out.  I expected that based on past experience that the
second new configuration would likewise fail.  It did not.

So that is tonight's experience.

73, de Nate &gt;&gt;
