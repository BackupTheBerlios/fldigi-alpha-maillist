Dick, if the LED in the rig is lit indicating transmit mode, then the
command *must* have been received by the '590.  Now, I don't have one
handy to verify, but are you sure you're in the right mode?  My K3 will
go into TX but won't get any audio input from the back panel until it is
in DATA mode (PKTUSB in Fldigi).

Update!  See below.

&gt;<i> Can you provide Dave a new backend for the TS-590S?
</I>
I just downloaded the owners manual from Kenwood and I see an erro in
the communications parameters.  It shows 9600 and 115200 bps using 1
stop bit and 4800 bps using 2 stop bits.  The Hamlib backend shows a
range of 4800 to 115200 with 1 stop bit.  I'll change that.

&gt;<i> What Kenwood (or other) backend would you suggest as being close to the 
</I>&gt;<i> new backend you prepared for the TS-590S in the new Hamlib version?
</I>
For PTT, probably no other as I see that the TS-590 has added a
parameter to the TX command (see page 23 of the PC Command Reference For
the TS-590S Transceiver manual).  This will be a bit complicated to
implement.  I do think that I can use the PKTUSB/PKTLSB Hamlib modes to
select the parameter value of 1 for DATA SEND (ACC2/USB inout) and any
other mode will use the normal PTT command.

&gt;<i> I have messed with Hamlib options so much I may have something set
</I>&gt;<i> incorrect that is preventing fldigi from keying the TS-590S.  I tried

</I>
The radio does not appear to support 57.6 bps, just 9600 and 115200 bps.

Gee, it;s bed time!

73, de Nate &gt;&gt;
