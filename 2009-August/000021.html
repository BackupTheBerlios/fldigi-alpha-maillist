<PRE>I will reply to the list in case it's of help to others.
I should have added.
The web-cam needs enabling in the bios, Xandros obviously can switch it
any way but Ubuntu can't and the recording test fails with the
default .ogg encoding but is OK with the other 3.
I intend to try the puppy and have got one 8 gig SD card ready.
I would have tried the puppy earlier if the 701 had recognised the right
partition on the usb stick as bootable.
But the second stick I used to rung the ubuntu image on can be
remastered for puppy.
Nice article in QST re aprs txt messaging or more generally ham text
messaging wonder if fidigi will a txt tab some time.

Interesting I just noticed the random muting of the audio issue is back
on the main ubuntu machine I wonder what update has caused that.
It might not hep having 2 pci cards plus the signLink

</I>&gt;<i>         &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; Hi.
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; For those who don't know the 7 is for 7 inch screen
</I>&gt;<i>         (800x400) and the SD
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; is for solid disk in this case 8 Gig.
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; Our local Staples store were selling off 2 units.
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; One in black with no power unit was the cheapest so I took a
</I>&gt;<i>         gamble on
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; it. 9.5v at 2.5A should not be hard to organise I thought.
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; But back at the office I discovered the books and the unit
</I>&gt;<i>         do not even
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; indicate which way round the the power connects.
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; Well for the price I reckoned I ought to have a spare ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; The other unit is in white and had a power unit with it for
</I>&gt;<i>         a little
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; more.
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; 2 netbooks for a shade over &#163;200 is not a bad deal.
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; Both units are the Linux version and were the display models
</I>&gt;<i>         so had been
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; set up and messed with.
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; When I did the updates I got disk full messages.
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; By email Asus sent info on how to sort that but it is a bit
</I>&gt;<i>         of a fiddle
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; and involves playing with partitions whilst booted from a
</I>&gt;<i>         memory stick.
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; The Linux is Xandros and the first partition is read only
</I>&gt;<i>         and updates
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; are done on the second partition and the first is
</I>&gt;<i>         marked .......
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; So I having googled a bit I decided to put the Ubuntu
</I>&gt;<i>         netbook remix on
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; one machine. The other I have done a factory reset on and
</I>&gt;<i>         only done the
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; most critical updates so I can at least have play with the
</I>&gt;<i>         Xandros.
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; I guess the ability to restore to factory conditions is the
</I>&gt;<i>         price paid
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; for the read only partition.
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; The point of this mail is to say I have just loaded the npa
</I>&gt;<i>         binary from
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; Dave's site and hamlib via synaptic and the little box is
</I>&gt;<i>         happily
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; reading a DL station via the internal mic with appropriately
</I>&gt;<i>         a 3 foot
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; air gap.
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; The set-up screen is behind the main screen and I can't get
</I>&gt;<i>         it to the
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; fore but as I said I just downloaded and started it in the
</I>&gt;<i>         normal way.
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; Oddly they will not boot my Puppy usb stick but that may
</I>&gt;<i>         just be because
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; they only see the first partition which was left as a small
</I>&gt;<i>         FAT to allow
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; use on a work machine.
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; But I have another stick to play with so I should have puppy
</I>&gt;<i>         running as
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; well.
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; So that's another Linux set up to test with.
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; And a more portable system to take out with the FT817.
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; Not must technical stuff to get you teeth into I know.
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; BTW the 701SD has external monitor 3 usb ports Lan and
</I>&gt;<i>         wireless, plus
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; mic and phones sockets as well as built in mic and webcam.
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; So in an emergency use web-cam to take picture an send it
</I>&gt;<i>         back to base
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; is possible as the unit is so small.
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; Or use another camera and transfer via the built in SD slot.
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; It's one step nearer to fldigi on my windows 6 had held
</I>&gt;<i>         device ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt;
