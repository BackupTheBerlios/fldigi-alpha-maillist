Don't forget to try Olivia, DominoEX, and Thor.

Well, if you are copying PSK31 and RTTY then your setup of PowerSDR
and fldigi are generally correct. You don't need to change anything
except the CW modem settings in fldigi.

&gt;<i> What can cause that ?. Should the F5000A be in CWU ?.

</I>&gt;<i> I tried that, but then the audio is not coming thru.

Any time you are using fldigi you need to have the radio set on DIGU.
You are using the radio as a linear translator to convert from the
operating frequency to a low IF of about 1500 Hz. Also, VAC is only on
by default if you are in DIGU or DIGL mode.

The only time you are likely to use DIGL is when you are using an AFSK
RTTY program that expects the radio to be in lower-sideband mode
(inverting linear translator). There are still some that expect that.
Newer programs, e.g. fldigi, do the mark/space tone inversion in the
digital-mode software and hence require the radio to be in USB mode.

As for decoding CW, I have found fldigi can be somewhat touchy. You
want to narrow the radio's filter to encompass the CW signal and its
keying sidebands. (The waterfall will help you see where the power is
adjacent to the carrier.) Do this for the CW filter width in fldigi as
well. (Someday the radio and the CODEC will be one program and you
wan't have to set the same information twice.) Remember that faster
keying rates produce sidebands farther from the carrier and need wider
filters. This ensures that other signals are not modulating the AGC.
Next you want to try to set the WPM rate as closely as possible to the
actual rate being sent. Yes, the program will &quot;track&quot; the keying rate
but the farther away you set the default rate from the actual rate,
the less likely you are to get a good decode quickly. Also, it isn't
going to do a very good job of decoding hand-sent CW unless the op has
a good fist with consistent rate and rhythm.

When I have done all these things, I find I get good copy about 80% of
the time. Just between you, me, and the lamppost, the best way to copy
CW on your computer is to copy it in your head and type into a text
editor. ;-)
