The jumping, pulsing panadaptor display was a bug in some versions of
PowerSDR. As far as I know, that bug was squashed about 3-4 months ago
but obviously if you use SVN to build some versions of PowerSDR you
are going to experience that problem. As far as I know neither the
current release version of PowerSDR (1.18.2), nor the current version
from the test branch (I am not in front of a machine that will let me
check) have that problem. I suspect that some branches may still have
the problem as they are addressing other areas of development.

Double check that firewire buffer sizes and sample rates match between
the radio's firewire driver and PowerSDR itself. Also, make sure that
the settings in VAC (sample rates supported and buffer sizes) match
the settings in PowerSDR. PowerSDR can handle buffer-size mismatch but
it ends up creating a LOT of processing overhead which may show up as
a result of: a) increased CPU usage when fldigi is runnig, and/or, b)
blocking due to buffer starvation due to buffer size mismatch.

The bottom line is that fldigi, both the alpha and release versions,
seem to be working fine in general with both the latest SVN test
branch or the released version of PowerSDR so you need to look at some
of the other things that could be affecting performance.
