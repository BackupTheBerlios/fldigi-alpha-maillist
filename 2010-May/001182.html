<PRE>Rick,

My original point is directed toward, in our case, the vast majority of 
ops who don't use, or have no intention of ever using, Rig control, 
which in my opinion is nothing but a distraction from what I thought was 
the intended purpose of NBEMS which is &quot;Emergency&quot; Communications, not 
flashy contesting/logging features like you see on HRD/DM780.

When someone downloads and installs FLDIGI for the first time, they see 
3850, which is just pointless and confusing. Why is it a major point of 
contention to suggest that you display zeros rather than show an 
arbitrary frequency when rig control is not being deployed?

Here's the text from the help file:
		###################################
Both are shown on Windows Vista controlling the author's FT-450.  The 
same control is used when the transceiver does not support CAT.  When no 
CAT is available the control is simply a convenient way of keeping track 
of the transceiver USB/LSB frequency, the mode and the audio tracking point.
		###################################

Perhaps it should also say, &quot;3583 is just a random figure we decided to 
set as a default when rig control is not deployed and does not convey 
any relevant or useful information to the user&quot;.

-Dave

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Two points here:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 1. If you have two displays, they should display the same thing if
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> they are supposed to display the same thing. Anything else is
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> confusing to the operator.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Exactly.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That's why you should be able to turn the fldigi display off, as point was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> made earlier. It's duplicated data, potentially a slowdown/confusion to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> operator. The radio is on the frequency it says it is, that's all anyone
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> needs to know.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, just shut off the display.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 2. The frequency display on the radios is almost never the actual
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> frequency of the transmission.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Correct and the Fldigi frequency display in question isn't intended to display 
</I>&gt;<i> the actual transmitted frequencies. Although this is an area that 
</I>&gt;<i> inexperienced and untrained hams always have trouble with. Again, it's a 
</I>&gt;<i> training issue. Hams need to know what the software and hardware they are 
</I>&gt;<i> putting on the air is doing. It's not idiot proof and never will be.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Uh, no. If I'm tuned to 14.230 MHz on the radio, and I'm receiving a FAX
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> signal that is AFSK between 1500 Hz and 2300 Hz, then the transmission is,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in fact, on 14.230 Mhz - the &quot;center&quot; (1900 Hz, or 14.2319 MHz) is not only
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *not* where the radio is tuned, if it *was* tuned there (you'd have to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> offset the fax modem to do it), then if the operator of the transmitter
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  were to speak up and tell you &quot;that was a fax of the important document
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  you asked for&quot;, you wouldn't be able to understand them, because you're
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  incorrectly tuned. Furthermore, if you were to send a fax back, you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  typically want the radio on 14.230 as well; otherwise, you have to operate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  split.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The correct frequency IS the frequency the radio is tuned to. Not whatever
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fldigi calculates as the modem center. This stuff is AFSK. Note the AF.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The radio dial frequency is the readout in Fldigi. The AFSK waterfall 
</I>&gt;<i> frequency, added to that radio dial frequency, for the various audio tones, is 
</I>&gt;<i> the frequency, or frequencies, of actual transmission. The operating ham needs 
</I>&gt;<i> to know this. Many times it is not a single frequency, but several or a range. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There are numerous reasons to receive signals at the tones they were
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> designed to be sent at. If you have external gear of almost any kind, RTTY,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> packet, SSTV, FAX, etc, they're going to be expecting very specific AF
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tones. The tones you'll get when your radio is tuned appropriately, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  when the signal falls on the AF indications on the waterfall that are the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  design points for the mode - for FAX, that's 1500 hz and 2300 hz. For
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  SSTV, 1200, 1500...2300 Hz. For RTTY, etc.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Fldigi does calculate and display the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> actual center frequency only in the log window.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It's a misleading number at best. The correct frequency is the one the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  radio is telling you. For optimum operations, the waterfall should be set
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  to AF, the modems should be at the design points, and the frequency
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  display is misleading and/or duplicates the radio display, consumes UI
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  space that could be better used for something useful, and should probably
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  be disabled as a direct consequence. Speaking of any situation where we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  are not just entertaining ourselves, but are working in circumstances
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  where correct operation may have social or human consequences. There is no
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  benefit to fldigi's frequency display when it is duplicating the radio's;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  there is no benefit when it is displaying a misleading &quot;center frequency,&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  either. If you were using it to preview fldigi memories, that I can see.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Otherwise... I have yet to be presented with a point in its favor.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For one thing, it's live. It controls the radio remotely if you have CAT 
</I>&gt;<i> working. It's a confirmation where the radio dial is set. I rarely touch the 
</I>&gt;<i> radio when doing digital. You don't need to.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Request: I would like the option of having the main fldigi display
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> show the actual transmission center frequency for the mode.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That is not and never was it's intended purpose. It is designed to control the 
</I>&gt;<i> CAT of the radio, and/or to indicate the carrier reinsertion frequency of the 
</I>&gt;<i> rig, for waterfall audio frequency addition or subtraction for logging.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Besides, for some digital modes the frequency stated for nets and skeds is 
</I>&gt;<i> definitely *not* the center frequency of the tone(s) transmitted. For some it's 
</I>&gt;<i> the start tone, or the others the mark tone.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You are missing the entire intended purpose of the display of frequency. It 
</I>&gt;<i> would appear for your purposes maybe you need to just shut it off.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It works as intended and that operation is clear to anyone who has taken the 
</I>&gt;<i> time to read the manual and to understand how the digital modes that they are 
</I>&gt;<i> transmitting work. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Being inexperienced is no substitute for knowing what you are doing with any 
</I>&gt;<i> transmitter you are controlling.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Again, this is a training issue. Get the operators trained so that they know 
</I>&gt;<i> what they are doing and more importantly where their transmitted signal is 
</I>&gt;<i> going.
