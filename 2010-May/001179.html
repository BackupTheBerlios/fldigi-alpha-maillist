No, it isn't correct. For an SSB mode, &quot;the frequency&quot; is where 0 Hz is.
Other than that, the frequencies are all over the passband, and will vary
hugely depending upon what you're doing. You're still tuned to the same
place, though.

Ok. Here's the crux of the matter. Why does &quot;the operating ham need to know
this&quot;?

I can easily understand why you'd want to know the AF frequencies involved,
so you can correctly tune the radio to the transmission and so that any
filters, if shift, bandwidth adjustments can be made in a sensible
fashion... the received information is pure AF once it's been detected...
but I can't think of a single use for the information that &quot;FAX black is
received on 14.2319 MHz&quot; when my receiver should be on 14.230 MHz USB, or
&quot;RTTY Mark is received on 14.07725 MHz&quot; when my receiver should be on 14.080
MHz LSB.

Please enlighten me here. What *is* fldigi's display of RF, as opposed to
AF, frequency good for, and why does the operator &quot;need to know&quot;?

On the other hand, if the waterfall is set to AF, and the modem is set
correctly (let's say that RTTY mark is at 2125 Hz where it belongs), then I
can tune the radio while looking at the waterfall during reception, and I'll
be exactly on the correct RF frequency every time, by simply putting the
mark signal on the mark frequency, 2125 Hz.

Whereas... if the modem has been &quot;slid&quot; off the correct AFSK points, then
I'll be receiving on the wrong frequency; my transmit signal will come back
shifted to the original signal (which is what defines my frequency as
wrong); my opposite number wil have to re-tune his receiver; and any
external gear I might have - RTTY filters, SSTV receivers, etc., will be
completely unable to deal with the received signal, because the AF
frequencies are wrong.

I think it is important to keep in mind that the vast majority of digital
modes are sent and received as AFSK, not FSK, and that the cutesy trend to
try and specify frequencies based on FSK mark for those few transmitters
that actually have a mode that can be used for RTTY, for instance, is both
confusing to everyone else, and not particularly useful in and of itself. In
the end, these are AF frequencies for almost everyone. It behooves us well
to treat them that way - almost everything works better that way.
