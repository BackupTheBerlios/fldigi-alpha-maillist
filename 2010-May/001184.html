&gt;<i> Well, confusion in the mind of the confused. The important thing is,
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;what frequency is my RF coming out on?&quot; I would rather have the
</I>&gt;<i> option of displaying that.
</I>
Might be something to consider.

However, the frequency readout inside of Fldigi is a part of the rig control 
CAT portion of the app, and because of this, it's directly setting the radio's 
dial frequency. It's not supposed to indicate the frequency of transmission.

I think this is as it should be. 

It is here that I can control the rig's tuning. It is not there to assist you 
in knowing where you are transmitting. That is handled in the waterfall via 
the frequency readouts there or by you if you have no CAT and are summing the 
radio frequency with the waterfall audio frequency.

I don't see how the two can be reconciled and I need things the way they are 
to operate digital.

You are asking for some sort of moving readout that follows the waterfall 
maybe? It's basically there when Fldigi calculates the waterfall frequency or 
sums the audio frequency to the radio dial readout for logging. 

I don't know. It seems too confusing to me. By convention when you treat the 
audio passband as baseband, the appropriate starting point is always the 
carrier reinsertion frequency. 

You are going to wind up having untrained operators moving the radio dial from 
the appropriate carrier reinsertion point, which as was mentioned up the 
thread there is some flexibility of based on knowing where you are transmitting 
and your equipment, but the untrained operator may well wind up with an 
inappropriate radio dial setting and compensate using the waterfall cursor, 
thus winding up inefficiently using the equipment or rendering the connection 
impossible. It will look to them like they are on the right frequency, but the 
combination of carrier reinsertion point and radio dial setting may be 
unusable.

It all boils down to the operator having to understand what they are doing. 
And that is training. It's not that hard. If we really have operators that are 
that unable to understand what and where they are going to be transmitting, 
should they even be transmitting at all?

I don't want the Fldigi display to display anything but the radio dial 
setting. I think that is as it should be. The rest is determined from the 
waterfall AF. CAT allows the waterfall to display the actual dial frequency. 
Non-CAT displays the AF. 

If you have the modem sweet spot set where you want it, and are not using CAT 
control, the program is going to come up set right unless some untrained 
operator clicks off the appropriate spot on the waterfall.

If you disable the frequency readout and tell the op to make sure the cursor 
is set at the appropriate audio frequency, does not get the job you want done?

Is this all over VHF/UHF FM or something?
