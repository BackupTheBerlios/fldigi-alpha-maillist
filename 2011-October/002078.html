<PRE>Hi,

What's the plan now ?

Sujet: BerliOS will be closed on 31.12.2011

Dear BerliOS developers and users,

BerliOS was founded 10 years ago as one of the first repositories in 
Europe. It was developed and maintained by Fraunhofer FOKUS. As an 
European, non-proprietary project BerliOS pursued the goal to support 
the various open-source players and provide a neutral mediator function. 
In 2011 over 4710 projects have been hosted on BerliOS,
with 50,000 registered users and over 2.6 million file downloads each 
month. We are proud that with BerliOS we have brought the idea of an OSS 
repository to Europe. Meanwhile, the concept has prevailed and there are 
many good alternatives.

Unfortunately, as a research institute Fraunhofer FOKUS has only few 
opportunities to operate a repository like BerliOS. Such a project will 
only work with a follow-up financing, or with sponsors or partners 
taking over the repository. In the field of OSS this is a difficult 
undertaking. In a recent survey the community indicated some support in 
funds and manpower which we would like to thank you for. Unfortunately, 
the result is not enough to put the project on a sustainable financial 
basis. In addition the search for sponsors or partners was unsuccessful.

Open Source is understood by Fraunhofer FOKUS as a paradigm for 
future-oriented intelligent use of IT. It hurts us all the more that we 
are forced to discontinue the hosting for BerliOS by 31.12.2011.

* As a developer, you should export your BerliOS project into another 
repository.
Alternatives see 
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_open_source_software_hosting_facilities">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_open_source_software_hosting_facilities</A>

* On our site you will find a guide on how to get your project data out 
of the portal and migrate it in a different platform, see
<A HREF="http://developer.berlios.de/docman/display_doc.php?docid=2056&amp;group_id=2">http://developer.berlios.de/docman/display_doc.php?docid=2056&amp;group_id=2</A>

Fraunhofer FOKUS has a strong commitment to open source and 
interoperability, and is involved in numerous successful OSS projects. 
The institute focuses on the development of quality standards for open 
source software and in particular on the technical, semantic and 
organizational interoperability between open source software components 
and between open source and closed source software. Example of our OSS 
activities including our management of the German Competence Center 
QualiPSo.

We thank all who have used BerliOS over the years.
