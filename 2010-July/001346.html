This is a matched pair distribution.  flwrap 1.3.0 will work with 
earlier versions of fldigi but the ^ handling will not be present in 
fldigi.  This probably does not effect plain text transfers, but it 
might if compression / base64 encoding is used by flwrap.

========================================================================
ATTENTION OS X testers:

I would like your opinion on a proposed change to the way that all of 
the application folders are stored on OS X.  This change would make it 
easier to locate the various data folders both from the &quot;Finder&quot; and 
from within fldigi when a file locate dialog is opened.  The changed is 
prompted by the fact that the default (and OS X preferred) behavior of 
Finder is to NOT show hidden files.  It is possible to change this 
behavior, but OS X does not make it easy to make the change.  The file 
locate dialog behavior seems to be fixed and suppresses all hidden 
directories and files.

Current         Proposed
$HOME/.fldigi   $HOME/fldigi.files
$HOME/.nbems    $HOME/nbems.files
$HOME/.flrig    $HOME/flrig.files

If the change is implemented it will be very easy to copy your current 
directory(s) contents to the new convention without loss of the old 
data.  The change will be made using a Terminal window and instructions 
will be created to assist you in the change over.

Please comment on whether you think this will enhance your operations.

fldigi Version 3.20.22

  TX file insertion
    * For both file insert and drag-n-drop insert into the Tx widget
      Change all occurrences of ^ to ^^.
    * Effect is to treat all dnd text as plain text without special fldigi
      control sequences.

  Xmlrpc Raw data
    * Added xmlrpc method, rxtx.get_data, which returns the contents
      of a char data buffer (max 256).  Data buffer contains all
      text received/transmitted since last query.  Caller responsible
      for separating the two.
    * Added xmlrpc method, rx.get_data, which returns the contents
      of a char buffer (max 256).  Data buffer contains all text
      received since last query.
    * Added xmlrpc method, tx.get_data, which returns the contents
      of a char buffer (max 256).  Data buffer contains all text
      transmitted since last query.

  Log Sort
    * Changed logbook sort to DATE / TIME-ON comparison
    * Changed logbook browser to show DATE / TIME-ON vice DATE / TIME-OFF

  Xmlrpc BS char
    Added new method to FTextTX to support backspace char from an 
external program.

  RsID
    * Added missing support code for patch c8ea4df
      This enables the encode and decode for the new RsID codes
    * Added Contestia 4/125 to menu and popup mode selector

========================================================================

flwrap Version 1.3.0

  Control-High bit Codes
    * Changed plain text documents to include control codes and
      high order bits.
    * CR, LF and TAB passed through unchanged.  Other control codes
      modified by adding 0x20 and preceeding with |+
    * 0x80 &lt; ch &lt; 0xBF converted to 0x20 to 0x5F and preceded by |-
      0xC0 &lt; ch &lt; 0xFF converted to 0x20 to 0x5F and preceded by |_
    * All occurrences of | changed to ||
    * Added dialog control to select Compression - default OFF
