Go back to my suggested settings, increase the write delay in increments 
of 10 and see what you get.

Your are correct, none are needed.


&gt;<i> The interface is based on one that I found on the web, which

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Radio to TTL Tx1, Tx2, and Rx1
</I>&gt;<i> - Computer to RS-232 Tx1 and Rx1
</I>&gt;<i> - Other devices to TTL Rx2
</I>&gt;<i> - RS-232 Tx2 wired to Rx2
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, I am using an external wall-wart to a 5v regulator,
</I>&gt;<i> so no power is being pulled from the RS-232 interface.
</I>
Perfect choice for an interface. I built one usng the same schematic, so 
we know its not the interface.


&gt;<i> This design isolates the radio from the rest of the CI-V equip-
</I>&gt;<i> ment. I was having issues with the TTL signal being pulled to zero
</I>&gt;<i> volts when my radio and SteppIR were connected to the same Tx
</I>&gt;<i> and Rx inputs when I had the radio set to transceive on the
</I>&gt;<i> CI-V line.
</I>
Were you able to correct this problem ?

Now, when you built from source did you run ::

sudo apt-get build-deps fldigi

first ? Did you have any errors when you were building from source ?

You did uncheck use hamlib and check use rigCAT ?

You did click the red intialize after every change ?

You do have commands are echoed checked ?

The last 3 are the most overlooked items, I'm just verifying that you 
did and have rechecked your settings.
