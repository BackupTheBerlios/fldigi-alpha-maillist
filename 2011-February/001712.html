<PRE>flrig v1.0.1.2

I have noticed that the CIV codes sent for the IC-7600 and the IC-7800 to
select VFOa and VFOb are not correct, in that in these two transceivers they
use different codes from other Icom rigs. They are in fact named differently
as well, being &quot;select main band&quot; and &quot;select sub band&quot; with civ codes of 07
D0 and 07 D1 respectively and not the 07 00 and 07 01 for the other rigs.
(presently flrig does not have the 7800 in its rig selection so that is a
mute issue.)

A quick change in the ic-746.cxx base file to send the correct codes ( I
could not fathom out how else to do this quickly and correctly [I changed
lines 122 and 132 respectively] ) ends up at times with a race condition
with the VFOs on the rig quickly switching between A and B. (I had noticed
the race condition previously with an earlier build, but it would usually
time out). In fact after stabilizing it comes back racing again after a
while.

I have verified that when the incorrect codes are sent. that the 7600 just
sends an error message back and does nothing else. Which makes me wonder how
it is working half as well as it is right now.

I am at a loss to see how to correct this. I noticed this feature and went
looking into it further after trying to change the frequency on VFOb  and
finding that VFOb always reverts to the VFOa frequency, and can not be set
independently when VFOa is the active VFO Without a rig attached and set to
the 7600, the frequency reversion feature is almost instantaneous, with the
rig connected it is noticeably slower.

Of note for the future of fldigi is that the new IC-7410 and now the IC-7600
both  have CIV codes to send CW as commands and no longer need to use either
an audio tone under SSB, or else to use true keying with a connection to the
key line. But Icom still has not gone for true FSK for RTTY through CIV yet,
or to have a way to send decoded RTTY using the rigs extra dsp audio filters
through CIV.
