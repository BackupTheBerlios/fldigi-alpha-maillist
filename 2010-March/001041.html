<PRE>Dave, et. al.,

I'll do some more testing on this.  After I observed this situation with
PSK125, I tried the same thing with PSK31 and did not observe the problem.
However, it might be difficult to test this since there are few PSK125
signals on the air.

Another observation:  There were lightning crashes at the time this was
happening, and even without the PSK browser open, I would occasionally lose
characters due to the crashes, but then it would continue decoding.  When I
would open the browser window, I would usually get a few characters, then
there would be a crash, then total scramble.  It appeared that the cursor in
the waterfall would drift off a little bit when the crash would occur, but
even when I would click on it to get it back on trace (hence hoping to
decode a few seconds of lost decoding), nothing would decode - total
gibberish.  I wonder if having the PSK browser window open was reducing the
ability of the decoder engine to properly decode signals with low S/N, but
may not be noticeable with signals with a high S/N.

Another possibility:  Even though I tried this opening/closing of the
browser window about 5 times, and every time it blew the decoding, perhaps
it was just poor conditions and my observation was coincidentally
artifactual.  Conditions were certainly marginal.

If I observe this again, I'll try the suggestion by Mike, KL7MJ, to create a
new preferences file.

73,
-Joe-
