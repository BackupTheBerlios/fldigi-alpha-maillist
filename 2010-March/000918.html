<PRE>Closing the loop on this one.

The &quot;problem&quot; of not showing the preamble and postamble tones on Olivia 
is not unique to 3.13CA and greater. This has been around for a long 
time. It has to do with the size of the audio samples passed from the 
modem class to waterfall widget. The waterfall drop rate and display is 
based on receiving blocks of audio that are 512 samples long. Olivia was 
passing a sample set of 8000 during the pre and post amble periods. 
Perfectly good set of audio samples, just too big for the way that 
fldigi's waterfall FFT processes the samples. A very simple fix in the 
Olivia code and the tones are now perfectly visible on the waterfall. 
The fix also resolves the waterfall delay previously seen during those 
intervals.

I will publish a 3.20.0b3 with this and two other fixes to non critical 
bug reports.

Only associated with Olivia. I will look at Olivia specific changes from 
BZ to current.
