<PRE>Stelios, sorry for the duplicate, I keep forgetting which email I'm
subscribed with here, and Google is of no help keeping it straight --
there's no way to filter a message to assign the reply address. --

I was thinking of functions that were compiled in on a per-version
basis, not run-time loadable functions. So the first version might
have two or three of the most useful functions; the next version four
or five; etc.

It's still only sane to have a standard &quot;make a process&quot; definition.

&gt;<i> IMO it's much better to just have an option specifying a program to be

</I>
This creates two files where no file needs to exist (the data is
already in memory); it slows *everything* down (adjust brightness is
now the hugely cumbersome [fldigi save file, brite load it, brite
process it, brite save it, fldigi reload it]) so processes that were
live, running in tiny fractions of a second, now thrash your disk to
no good purpose at all, are no longer visibly interactive, and take
much, much longer. These can be significant files. I *really* don't
need two multi-megabyte temporary file writes to my drives just to
adjust brightness or filter noise.

&gt;<i> It's trivial to get to the RGB data and there are many
</I>&gt;<i> image processing libraries than can open PNG files directly.
</I>
Nothing wrong with saving a PNG, and the program already does it, both
automatically and on command. I'm a huge fan of PNG; my commercial
image processing software was one of the first to support PNG when it
came out, many years ago. Heck, we can even write MNG files, and that
*really* puts us in a small minority!

But it is a mistake to think that &quot;PNG out, postprocess(PNG in,
function,PNG out), PNG in&quot; is even remotely similar to adding
in-program noise removal, dynamic range controls, etc.

These are extremely lightweight functions, too. The only likely weight
to them at all will be the UI.
