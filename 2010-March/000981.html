<PRE>&gt;<i> Although the yellow mouse cursor over the waterfall is active during WEFAX
</I>&gt;<i> operation allowing you to set the red decoding cursor, decoding is always
</I>&gt;<i> centered at 1900 Hz. You need to tune your receiver 1.9 kHz below the listed
</I>&gt;<i> frequency (USB of course). Perhaps the yellow mouse cursor could be disabled
</I>&gt;<i> and the red decode cursor fixed at 1900 Hz.
</I>
I agree -- the decoding is right where it ought to be, but the cursor
misleads you into thinking you can receive a non-standard signal.
Either the decoder should slide (I don't really think so...
1500...2300 is correct) or the movable cursor should lock to the
correct location (preferable... not everyone will know that 1900 hz is
the correct center frequency.

There is no configure / modem entry for the fax decoder. Just pointing
it out. Probably should be one, even if there are no options.

I tuned in an already running fax signal... couldn't see how to start reception.

The following are the basic features you need for a fax system:

1) manual start/stop
2) auto start/stop (switchable option)
3) auto home to top (switchable option)
3) manual shift of received image and concurrent adjustment of
sampling location to align edges
4) fine timing trim to get the edges straight (fax is synchronous,
computers differ enough to screw it up.)
5) zoom control from about 320 wide to full width.
6) line mode (threshold the signal to b/w at 1900 hz)
7) grey mode - linear grey levels from black (1500 hz) to white (2300 hz)
8) reception to memory so display is never a restricting factor on
resolution or sample rate

&gt;<i>From there, a plug-in system for image processing operators would be wonderful.
</I>
&gt;<i> The displayed images and the file captures are stretched in the vertical
</I>&gt;<i> dimension. Circles appear quite egg-shaped. This may be more related to the
</I>&gt;<i> station I was receiving than the program itself, but it would be cool if
</I>&gt;<i> there were some way to compensate for that.
</I>
All fax uses square pixels. Sub-sampling of the received data is
required for correct display at any ratio other than 1 fax pixel = 1
display pixel.

This looks like a great start. I'm really excited!
