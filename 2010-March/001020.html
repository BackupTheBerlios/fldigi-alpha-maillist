It is still a good idea. I have been having problems with the NTP
client in Windows not updating the system clock. I discovered this
when I noticed that I stopped decoding WSPR even though it was clear
from the waterfall that there was ample signal.

So on start-up I do a quick check of all the WWV frequencies to check
time and get a ballpark approximation of propagation.

I think someone mentioned that NTP determines and applies a clock bias
so that when there is no NTP the clock remains closer to real-time.
That is indeed the case with a full implementation of NTP (xntpd) but
I believe that many simple NTP clients just send out a query
periodically and then reset the system clock with the answer. They
don't bother to try to determine round-trip time or to average the
replies in order to improve accuracy.

It seems to me that a really desirable station accessory is a combined
GPS-disciplined stratum-0 clock and frequency reference. I know that
with the various digital modes, more and more of my operating depends
on very accurate time and frequency.
