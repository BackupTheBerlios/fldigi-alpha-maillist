&gt;<i> Hello Ben,

</I>
What is fldigi written in? I have observed the executable is about 15 mb, so
I am guessing it is written in something object-oriented... C++? Where do I
learn about fldigi's development environment for Mac/OSX? Is there a package
one can download, copy to a dir, and compile, or a web page somewhere that
explains all of this? Once I have a source package that compiles into
fldigi, I might be able to work with the RTTY code, presuming the
implementation isn't over my head -- FM synthesis isn't how we used to do
it, back when a 10 MHz microprocessor was &quot;powerful.&quot; :o)


&gt;<i>   I did not know that 850 Hz shift was used by amateurs very much anymore.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I don't think it is used much (if at all) by Amateurs, however, it is used
extensively for meteorological forecasts and military bulletins. Meteo
forecasts are sent in the clear; military are (mostly) sent encrypted,
though they are still of interest to SWL utility monitors (the same way time
signals are... they tell you a lot about propagation from the callsigns and
occasional headers which are sent in the clear.)


&gt;<i>   All of my monitoring of RTTY especially during contests seem to indicate
</I>&gt;<i> 180 Hz shift.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Is 180 Hz a European amateur standard? I have only encountered 170 Hz shifts
in the amateur bands thus far. But propagation from Europe is horrible.

Also, during contests is the very best time of all to go explore the SW
bands. :o)
