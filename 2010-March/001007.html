<PRE>Yes, these things are all apparent to most of us... just like you'd 
think anyone out there should be able to find the program file 
directories by breezing through the file structure with explorer. Yet, 
folks will still have the wrong time or UTC correction made.  It's just 
a simple suggesting I was making... there are currently, and always will 
be, folks that will miss this. Maybe they're complete idiots not worthy 
of running emcomm ops, or maybe they just simply never look at the time 
settings on their computer... who knows.

The prompt on startup of fldigi for an op at an emcomm station, maybe on 
a computer that is not theirs, would catch the problem and just seems to 
be no big deal, at least to me.

Its no problem that this never gets put into FLDIGI.  It was only a 
suggestion.
