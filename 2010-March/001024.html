<PRE>Guys,

There are a lot of folks using the Signalink USB interface and fldigi now.
The Signalink uses VOX to enable PTT (no CAT control), so in thinking about
this as the receiving station, I frequently miss the first few characters of
the senders' message. We could remedy this by using a method similar to the
old analog modems RTS-CTS delay and sending a configurable increment of
&quot;idle&quot; so that the VOX delay could be absorbed and the interface switched to
TX mode before any data were passed to the modem. I would call this &quot;VOX PTT
Delay&quot; and would like it to be configurable for up to 1000 msec. I get
around this on my end by using the IDLE:nn macro call, but where I have to
type in any text, this won't work.
I don't know if the Signalink will detect &quot;right-channel audio&quot; for PTT, but
even those of us that might use any type of antenna or switch-over relays
could use such a feature to switch all circuits in before data starts being
sent (before TXiD). 
I would think that a single configurable parameter would be sufficient for
all modems as the interface would be common to the equipment configuration. 

Thanks,
 
Mitch Baum / AF2M
