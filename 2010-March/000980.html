I'd like to report that I built the WEFAX version listed above without 
incident on my 32-bit Slackware system and it seems to work nicely. For 
others wanting to try it who might not be familiar with WEFAX, the US 
National Weather Service has a handy and up-to-date guide to worldwide 
Radio FAX schedules here:

    <A HREF="http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/marine/rfax.pdf">http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/marine/rfax.pdf</A>

A few observations:

I was getting a strong signal but with a lot of selective fading from 
the Pt. Reyes California station on 8682 kHz. I had trouble getting the 
automatic phasing to work. Most times I had to hit the &quot;Skip phasing&quot; 
button when the picture started. I don't know if that was something I'm 
doing wrong or the program.

Although the yellow mouse cursor over the waterfall is active during 
WEFAX operation allowing you to set the red decoding cursor, decoding is 
always centered at 1900 Hz. You need to tune your receiver 1.9 kHz below 
the listed frequency (USB of course). Perhaps the yellow mouse cursor 
could be disabled and the red decode cursor fixed at 1900 Hz.

The displayed images and the file captures are stretched in the vertical 
dimension. Circles appear quite egg-shaped. This may be more related to 
the station I was receiving than the program itself, but it would be 
cool if there were some way to compensate for that.

Many thanks for the work.

Bob W6CP
