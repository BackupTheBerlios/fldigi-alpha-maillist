The Mac won't lose audio samples as far as I know. I am a professional
musician, and I have never noticed gaps in the audio from moving
windows and that sort of thing. Also, Multimode, another program that
does fax this way (using the Mac's audio device) never loses samples
no matter what you do with the machine, so I think that it's happening
at a higher level. Do you have a specific task whose job it is to get
samples from the audio and store them into the receive buffer? Or are
you putting the samples right into the display bitmap? Because there
will be times the display bitmap is locked, such as the re-allocation
you mention.

</I>
Yes, definitely. As I  have said earlier, this adjustment doesn't
generally apply to the incoming signal, but instead, corrects the
computer's error in timing. Further, no matter which (or if both), as
long as you stay on the same broadcast, the slant (and hence the
correction) will remain the same, so the unslant tuning should not be
reset between images. Let the user do that (and save it when the
program exits and restarts... mine is at .997 and every fax signal I
have seen so far is straightened by that value.
