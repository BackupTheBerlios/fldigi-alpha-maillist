<PRE>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> confirm start of image definitely resets line rate; shouldn't.
</I>
&gt;<i> Sorry for that, but I do not understand. Do you please mean that when a new
</I>&gt;<i> image starts is detected, it calculates LPM ? Yes, this is intended, so that
</I>&gt;<i> an image with a LPM of 60 is detected, even of the previous image has an LPM
</I>&gt;<i> of 120. Are we talking about the same things ?
</I>
Please don't calculate the line rate from the image. Let the user
select 120 or 240 from the menu, then stay in that mode. Or at least,
provide a UI switch that turns such automatic rate measuring off.
Every time the program re-calculates the line rate as 120.000, the
image becomes slanted. 119.997 is the value that actually makes 120
LPM fax straight on my machine, and I *really* don't want that value
changed unless I change it on purpose, once it is set. I haven't run
into a 240 LPM fax in months.

For the record, the number of times I've observed a particular fax
broadcast change line rates in twenty years of listening is... zero.
That includes the press people when they were broadcasting fax --
they're gone now, though. Sadly.

I always have a receiver turned on and a display dedicated to fax
reception. Always. For the last few years, it's been an FT-980. This
line rate RE-sensing is a feature that is simply creating a problem --
it is both unnecessary and intrusive, and a direct detriment to
usability.

So a switch please, if you wish to keep it around. Otherwise, by all
means, my input is just get rid of it. You should ask others what they
think about this as well, of course.
