<PRE>Hi all and sorry about the off topic, but I think some one may thanks 
this info (me, as the first interested people)

I have been working since jan 2011 in a set of scripts to make simpler 
the packet configuration in linux.

That work itself is called easypacket and I have not any mean of 
publishing it but this, it is launched as GPL 2.0 (Free software) and is 
in it's 1.0b3 release as a deb of about 15Kb.

Software features includes:
- automatic configuration of soundmodem and ax25d for 1k2, 4k8 and 9k6 
bauds, yes audio TNC, no hardware TNC.
- working and tested at 1k2 &amp; 4k8 AFSK and 9k6 FSK with less than  15% 
of packet loss in tcp/ip modes (4k8 &amp; 9k6) and 0% in 1k2
- full support of OSS and testing ALSA right now
- automatic detection of the correct sound card at bootup (ubuntu/debian 
swap the assignation of the interface on each bootup)
- start modems as simple as &quot;packeton 1k2&quot; or &quot;packeton 9k6&quot;
- stop modems as simple as &quot;packetoff&quot;
- deb packaged with dependences included
- faster modes as 4k8 and 9k6 need direct output of detector and direct 
access to the modulator on a radio not capable of 9k6, or a 9k6 capable 
radio
- implementation of new modes by demand is a breeze, as for example 2k4, 
or newQPSK
- auto configuration of the firewall for not to send tcp/udp packages 
that pollutes the radio channel
- must use a separate sound card for packet modem if you use a desktop 
on the machine, aka you have only one soundcard and use it for playing 
audio and video.
- user oriented
- have man pages of each script and the complete manual is a work in 
progress

Users interested in try it can contact me directly by email at 
<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/fldigi-alpha">pavel at conas.co.cu.</A>

This is a beta software and is not exempt of bugs, that's the point, I 
need users to try it to found that bugs, any help is welcomed.

At this time I have only 3 testers here in Cuba and we want to release 
it to the public.

If any of you knows a better place to discuss/improve this software, 
please let me know, but only email, I'm in Cuba and I can't get google 
groups or yahoo groups either, and much other sites are banned to me.

Dave please, if you can host the binaries in your site in the 
contributed software I will appreciate it.

Sorry again about the off-topic.
